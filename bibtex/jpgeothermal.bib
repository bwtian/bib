abstract = {The 2011Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake caused an unprecedented level of crustal deformation in eastern parts of Japan1–3. The event also induced seismic activity in the surrounding area, including some volcanic regions4,5, but has not yet triggered any eruptions. Here we use data from satellite radar and the Global Positioning System to show that volcanic regions, located between 150 and 200km from the rupture area6, ex- perienced subsidence coincident with the Tohoku earthquake. The volcanic regions subsided by 5–15 cm, forming elliptical depressions with horizontal dimensions of up to 15–20 km. The depressions are elongated in a direction roughly perpen- dicular to the axis of maximum coseismic extension. A high concentration of Late Cenozoic calderas7, high heat flow8, hot thermal waters9, and young and hot granite10 in the subsided regions imply the presence of magmatic and hot plutonic bodies beneath the volcanoes, that may have deformed and subsided in response to stress changes associated with the Tohoku earthquake along with the surrounding, thermally weakened host rocks. Similar subsidence observed in Chile following the 2010 Maule earthquake11 indicates that earthquake-triggered subsidence could be widespread in active volcanic chains along subduction zones.},

@article{Larsen2012,
abstract = {The steep topography of mountain landscapes arises from interactions among tectonic rock uplift, valley incision and landslide erosion on hillslopes. Hillslopes in rapidly uplifting landscapes are thought to respond to river incision into bedrock by steepening to a maximum stable or ‘threshold’ angle. Landslide erosion rates are predicted to increase nonlinearly as hillslope angles approach the threshold angle. However, the key tenet of this emerging threshold hillslope model of landscape evolution—the coupled response of landslide erosion to tectonic and fluvial forcing—remains untested. Here we quantify landslide erosion rates in the eastern Himalaya, based on mapping more than 15,000 landslides on satellite images. We show that landslide erosion rates are significantly correlated with exhumation rates and stream power and that small increases in mean hillslope angles beyond 30° translate into large and significant increases in landslide erosion. Extensive landsliding in response to a large outburst flood indicates that lateral river erosion is a key driver of landslide erosion on threshold hillslopes. Our results confirm the existence of threshold hillslopes and demonstrate that an increase in landslide erosion rates, rather than steepened hillslope angles, is the primary mechanism by which steep uplands respond to and balance rapid rates of rock uplift and bedrock river incision in tectonically active mountain belts.},
