abstract = {One application of lineaments interpreted from satellite images is to reveal dominant azimuth sets and distribution density of the derived lineaments for an extensive area. In this analysis, a lineament is treated literally as a straight line in the horizontal plane and any dip of the lineament is not considered. we propose a new method to calculate the azimuth (strike and dip angles) of 'fracture' planes through a combination of lineament maps and digital elevation models :(DEMs). A 'fracture' is created by connecting several lineaments, which appear to belong to the same system, using the criteria of distance and directional angle. The proposed method was applied to mines in an area of Cretaceous granite, an area of Miocene andesite and an area of Quaternary volcanic rocks in Japan. Lineaments in these areas were interpreted from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or SPOT panchromatic images using gthe segment tracing algorithm (STA). A correlation exists between interpreted 'fracture' orientations and (1) the predominant azimuth of joints appearing on the drift walls of a skarn deposit in the granite area and (2) the orientation of main gold veins in the andesite araea. Furthermore, interpreted 'fractures' are believed to act as conduits for transporting hydrothermal fluids to the surface in anhot spring area. Additionally, the proposed method is capable of calculating the intersection pattern of fractures at an arbitrary level below the ground surface.},

abstract = {This study developed a geobotanical remote sensing method for detecting high water table zones using differences in the conditions of forest trees induced by groundwater supply in a humid warm-temperate region. A new vegetation index (VI) termed added green band NDVI (AgbNDVI) was proposed to discriminate the differences. The AgbNDVI proved to be more sensitive to water stress on green vegetation than existing VIs, such as SAVI and EVI2, and possessed a strong linear correlation with the vegetation fraction. To validate a proposed vegetation index method, a 23 km2 study area was selected in the Tono region of Gifu prefecture, central Japan. The AgbNDVI values were calculated from atmospheric corrected SPOT HRV data. To correctly extract high VI points, the influence factors on forest tree growth were identified using the AgbNDVI values, DEM and forest type data; the study area was then divided into 555 domains chosen from a combination of the influence factors and forest types. Thresholds for extracting high VI points were defined for each domain based on histograms of AgbNDVI values. By superimposing the high VI points on topographic and geologic maps, most high VI points are clearly located on either concave or convex slopes, and are found to be proximal to geologic boundaries-particularly the boundary between the Pliocene gravel layer and the Cretaceous granite, which should act as a groundwater flow path. In addition, field investigations support the correctness of the high VI points, because they are located around groundwater seeps and in high water table zones where the growth increments and biomass of trees are greater than at low VI points. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Geologic data obtained by drilling investigations, field measurements, and laboratory tests are irregularly distributed with respect to location both horizontally and vertically. Spatial discontinuities impact soil classification, hydraulic conductivity, and chemical content. In this study, a three-dimensional modeling method, which combines the optimization principle method and a stochastic simulation method, was developed (OPTSIM). This method consists of three steps: the transformation of geologic attributes into binary (0 or 1) under certain thresholds, the three-dimensional interpolation of these transformed binary data, and the construction of conditional cumulative distribution functions (CCDF) by repeatedly changing the threshold and interpolation analysis. The Monte Carlo method was then used to inversely determine the attributes from the constructed CCDFs. Three types of attribute expressed by value, code, and class were examined. The OPTSIM was applied to spatial modeling of geotechnical structures in the Kumamoto plain, southwest Japan, using two kinds of data, lithologic units and physical soil properties. Resistivity data obtained by electric logging and the locations of screens were linked to geologic distribution. The constructed model contributed to the location of chief aquifers and estimates of amount of shallow groundwater. A combination of granular composition, N value, and water content was examined. Transgression and regression patterns following the last glacial stage were also inferred through this analysis. In both applications, discontinuities in lithologic units and soil properties resulting from fault movements and sea-level changes were successfully expressed in the distribution models. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An understanding of the geomorphology and distribution of surface materials on an active volcano is crucial to characterize eruptions and mitigate volcanic hazards. For volcanoes, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing is the only useful observation and monitoring technology that can be undertaken in any weather condition. This letter uses the data from one type of airborne SAR system termed polarimetric and interferometric airborne SAR and L-band microwaves to classify SAR imagery into geomorphologic units, based on a scattering mechanism, using the example of Mt. Sakurajima, a representative active volcano situated in southern Japan. This is accomplished by adopting a Bayesian decision classification (BDC) scheme applied to two polarimetric parameters, namely, entropy and the type of scattering mechanism, which are derived from Cloude-Pottier decomposition of full polarimetry. In spite of the thick vegetation cover, BDC can divide SAR imagery from Mt. Sakurajima into three geomorphologic units: volcanic cone, terrace, and foot. The suitability of the BDC classification of microwave sensor imagery-and its superiority over a traditional classification scheme, the K -means unsupervised classification-is confirmed by polarimetric signature analysis and ground-truth surveying that directly quantifies surface scattering.},

abstract = {Morphotectonic lineaments observed on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt were auto-detected from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 90-m digital elevation model (DEM) and gravity grid data and then analyzed to characterize the tectonic trends that dominated the geologic evolution of this area. The approach employed consists of DEM shading, segment tracing, grouping, statistical analysis of the distribution and orientation of the lineaments, fault plane characterization, and smooth representation techniques. Statistical quantification of counts, mean lengths, densities, and orientations was used to infer the relative severity of the tectonic regimes, to unravel the prominent structural trends, and to demarcate the contribution of various faulting styles that prevailed through time. Restored to the present-day geographic position, prominent N50°-60°W, N20°-40°W, N50°-60°E, and N20°-30°E and less prominent N-S, E-W, and ENE trends were common. The prominence of these trends varied through time. The NW and NE trends showed relatively equal abundances in the Precambrian and the Cambrian whereas the prominence of the NW trends prevailed from the Carboniferous to the Holocene. Lineaments in all formations were near vertical and on average, about 65\% showed as strike-slip, 22\% as reverse, and 13\% as normal faulting styles. Statistics from the detected linear features and the reference geological data reveal the relative severity of five dominant tectonic regimes: Precambrian compression followed by extension at its end, Cretaceous compression, Eocene compression, Miocene extension, and finally Holocene compression. Auto-detected lineaments and the severity of the characterized tectonic periods correspond well with reference data on the geologic structure, geodynamic framework, and the gravity anomaly. Furthermore, the recent significance of the broad structural zones was confirmed by the foci of the earthquake epicenters along and at the intra-plate intersections of the broad lineament zones and at the plate boundaries. The spatial distribution of trends with varying styles of faulting distinguished four main tectonic provinces of marked geodynamics variances. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A set of techniques was developed for automatically detecting tectonic lineaments from multi-source remotely-sensed data at various scales. The techniques include adaptive shading of grid data to enhance linear features, a segment-tracing algorithm to extract line segments from the shaded grid data, grouping of the segments by concatenating short segments, and connecting them by proximity and co-linearity criteria to form a lineament that represents significant tectonic structure. B-spline smoothing was adopted for lineament representation. Finally, a technique for assessing the orientations and styles of faulting (normal, reverse, and strike-slip types) was developed for use in characterizing the extrapolated fracture planes. The applicability of the developed techniques was examined using 30. arc-second topography/bathymetry grids, 1-min gravity anomaly grids, and 2-min total field magnetic intensity grids covering Egypt and its surroundings. Lineaments derived from data types so diverse in composition and from various depths corresponded well with the referenced tectonic features over much of the region. Prominent trends and faulting styles of lineaments provided important clues as to the timing of their development as well as strong support for a structural inheritance model. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed techniques combined with integration of remotely-sensed data in detecting regional fracture systems accurately and in characterizing geodynamics over a long timeframe. © 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {One of the factors that determines the suitability of limestone for industrial use and its commercial value is phosphorus (P) content, i.e., the weight percentage of phosphorus contained in small quantities of limestone. Because P content changes locally, geostatistical techniques including semivariogram, ordinary kriging, and conditional indicator sequential simulation were used in this study to identify the spatial correlation of P content and to estimate its three-dimensional distribution in an open-pit mine. The P content data at 43,000 points of five different bench levels were analyzed. It was found that the horizontal semivariograms produced by using the data at the same bench level show anisotropic behavior and are represented by the sum of two spherical models with different ranges and sills. The twelve vertical semivariograms were also constructed from P content in boring cores. After these semivariograms were classified into four types, a multilayered neural network was applied to clarify the horizontal distribution of each one. One of the twelve semivariograms was assigned to an arbitrary grid point in the study area by the criterion that its type is the same as the one estimated at the point and the borehole site producing the semivariogram is the nearest to the point. With this technique, ordinary kriging combined with the semivariogram of borehole data provided a proper estimation of P content in the depth direction.},

abstract = {Water containing high concentrations of nitrate is unfit for human consumption and, if discharging to freshwater or marine habitats, can contribute to algal blooms and eutrophication. The level of nitrate contamination in groundwater of two densely populated, agro-industrial areas of the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL) (Banana Plain and Mount Cameroon area) was evaluated. A total of 100 samples from boreholes, open wells and springs (67 from the Banana Plain; 33 from springs only, in the Mount Cameroon area) were collected in April 2009 and January 2010 and analyzed for chemical constituents, including nitrates. The average groundwater nitrate concentrations for the studied areas are: 17.28 mg/l for the Banana Plain and 2.90 mg/l for the Mount Cameroon area. Overall, groundwaters are relatively free from excessive nitrate contamination, with nitrate concentrations in only 6 \% of groundwater resources in the Banana Plain exceeding the maximum admissible concentration for drinking water (50 mg/l). Sources of NO3 − in groundwater of this region may be mainly anthropogenic (N-fertilizers, sewerage, animal waste, organic manure, pit latrines, etc.). Multivariate statistical analyses of the hydrochemical data revealed that three factors were responsible for the groundwater chemistry (especially, degree of nitrate contamination): (1) a geogenic factor; (2) nitrate contamination factor; (3) ionic enrichment factor. The impact of anthropogenic activities, especially groundwater nitrate contamination, is more accentuated in the Banana Plain than in the Mount Cameroon area. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of multivariate statistical analysis in groundwater study as a supplementary tool for interpretation of complex hydrochemical data sets.},

abstract = {In addition to spatial distribution of groundwater-flow parameters, aquifer properties of location and shape are also significant for assessing groundwater resources because they strongly affect water flow. We present a selection of geologic data suitable for aquifer analysis, a mathematical method of processing them, and a combination of several maps produced by it. The data used in the analysis are typically obtained by borehole investigation. Our targets are the areas underlain by geologic bodies with different ages and lithologies; the spatial correlation structures of geologic data over the areas tend to change locally. The processing method should be a versatile one that is applicable to areas where geostatistical stationarity is not satisfied. The aquifer analysis consistent with that requirement consists of two steps: the first is the transformation of screen locations, locations of sand and gravel layers, and resistivity by electric logging into indicator values, and the second is three-dimensional interpolation of these using the optimization principle method to produce three kinds of distribution models. A stochastic simulation is also used for modeling the resistivity distribution. The three distribution models are integrated to generate a value for evaluating the possibility of aquifer existence. A case study of an alluvial coastal plain, situated in southwest Japan, describes an aquifer model that contains three permeable layers. Each layer has about 10-m thickness and is lens shaped. To confirm the validity of the model, we have drilled two wells that reached one of the middle and bottom permeable layers, observing the water level change. Low correlation of the temporal changes of levels between the wells indicates that the two layers are hydrologically independent of each other. Additionally, groundwater-flow patterns have been estimated by transforming the simulation model parameter into hydraulic conductivity through a simple function and using a finite difference method for flow analysis. The procedure proposed by this study can be applied to other areas by changing the weights assigned to each geologic and geotechnical factor in the generation of the coefficient for aquifer existence, considering the reliability of each factor and hydrologic properties of study area. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Because these areas are subject to earthquake damages, it is important to determine their seismic engineering characteristics. Geotechnical databases which contain many borehole logs are useful information sources for this type of analysis. Each datum stored in the database has a value or an attribute, and its location is irregular in both horizontal and vertical directions. A new interpolation method based on the optimization principle is proposed here to deal with such three-dimensionally distributed data. Susceptibility of unconsolidated ground to liquefaction is known to be related to the content of loose and saturated sand. The mixture ratio of several soil types in a deposit, i.e., granular composition, is strongly influenced by the sedimentary environment. There are two numerical methods: the optimization principle method (OPM) used to determine three-dimensional distribution of granular composition and the model used to evaluate liquefaction. The application of the proposed methods to two locations in Japan indicated that the zones with high susceptibility to liquefaction were indeed those that had suffered from liquefaction during past earthquakes.},

Rocks can be characterized mainly in terms of their lithology, mineralogy, fracture distribution, permeability, thermal conductivity and porosity, and similarly the geothermal fluid (and its circulation) by its geochemistry, flow pattern, velocity, temperature and pressure. Some of these data are obtained by well logging and from laboratory tests conducted on drillhole cores. In general, the distribution of geothermal wells is not random, and well data are limited in terms of quantity and depth range. Accordingly, a sophisticated spatial modeling technique is indispensable in the three-dimensional imaging of geothermal systems. We describe a versatile 3-D modeling method that can be used to determine the temperature, flow velocity, and distribution of geological units within a geothermal field based on well log data. The model results for the Hohi geothermal area, Japan, provide plausible estimates of temperature, flow velocity, and geology to a depth of 3000 m.

abstract = {This study presents a new geostatistical approach to characterization of the geometry and quality of a multilayer coal deposit using the data of seam thickness as a geometric property and the contents of ash, sodium, total sulphur, and the heating value as quality properties. A coal deposit in East Kalimantan (Borneo), Indonesia, which has a synclinal geological structure, was chosen as the study site. Semivariogram analysis clarified the strong dependence of heating value on ash content in the top and bottom parts of each seam and the existence of a strong correlation with sodium content over the sub-seams in the same location. The correlations between the geometry and quality of the seams were generally weak. A linear coregionalization model was used to derive the spatial correlation coefficients of two variables at each scale component from the single- and cross-semivariogram matrices. Because the data were correlated spatially in the same seam or over different seams, multivariate techniques (ordinary cokriging and factorial cokriging) were mainly used and the resultant spatial estimates were compared to those derived using a univariate technique (ordinary kriging). A factorial cokriging was effective to decompose the spatial correlation structures with different scales. Another important characteristic was that the sodium content shows distinct segregation: the low zones are concentrated near the boundary of the sedimentary basin, while the high zones are concentrated in the central part. The main component of sodium originates from the abundance of saline water. Therefore, it can be inferred that seawater had stronger effects on the coal depositional process in the central basin than in the border part. The geostatistical modeling results suggest that the thicknesses of all the major seams were controlled by the syncline structure, while the coal qualities chiefly were originated from the coal depositional and diagenetic processes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Widespread definition of a groundwater system in three dimensions is necessary for the management and maintenance of groundwater resources. A magnetotelluric (MT) survey can be an effective geophysical prospecting method for imaging regional geological structures by measuring both shallow and deep resistivity. To demonstrate the capability of an MT survey to characterize a groundwater system, the Kumamoto area of central Kyushu in southwestern Japan was selected as a case study site because of its rich groundwater resources. Three-dimensional (3D) MT resistivity structure to a depth of 5 km was modeled by 1D inversion analysis of raw MT data and 3D interpolation of the resultant resistivity column data by the optimization principle method. Consequently, both deep and shallow aquifers were detected. A high-resistivity zone appears at depths between 500 and 2,000 m between the Futagawa–Hinagu faults and the Usuki–Yatsushiro tectonic line, which supports the existence of an aquiclude under the aquifer. The most important characteristic inferred from the 3D resistivity model is that the deep groundwater system below a depth of 1,000 m has two main flow paths. One path is likely to be through porous rocks because the low resistivity zone is regarded as tuff with sand and gravel, and the other flow path is interpreted to be through fractured zones along the Hinagu faults. Hence, the path and direction of the groundwater flows are probably controlled by geologic structures and the configuration of the active faults. These findings support the effectiveness of the MT method for investigating groundwater systems.},

For determination of coal reserve uncertainty associated with tonnage and grade (quality), we present a new approach that stands on spatial modeling of seam distribution and coal quality. A multilayer coal deposit in East Kalimantan, Indonesia was selected as a case study site. Coal quality was evaluated by ash and sodium contents, total sulphur, and heating value. Their spatial models were produced by geostatistical methods, ordinary kriging and sequential Gaussian simulation, which were effective to evaluate local or global uncertainty by honoring spatial correlation structures. The seam distribution was modeled by a binary transformation of the geologic data and the three-dimensional optimization method. It is demonstrated that the lower seam sequence has the highest degree of uncertainty because of low average coal accumulation (tonnage) and the sparseness of sample data points in the north part of the study area. This study demonstrates that uncertainty of coal accumulation is related to the seam distribution and that spatial variability patterns of coal qualities are opposing between ash content and total sulphur: this difference might have been caused by geological controls. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fracture zones on the Earth's surface are important elements in the understanding of plate motion forces, the dynamics of the subsurface fluid flow, and earthquake distributions. However, good exposures of these features are always lacking in arid regions, characterized by flat topography and where sand dunes extensively cover the terrain. During field surveys these conditions, in many cases, hinder the proper characterization of such features. Therefore, an approach that identifies the regional fractures as lineaments on remotely-sensed images or shaded digital terrain models, with its large scale synoptic coverage, could be promising. In the present work, a segment tracing algorithm (STA), for lineament detection from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery, and the data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30 m digital elevation model (DEM), has been applied in the Siwa region, located in the northwest of the Western Desert of Egypt. The objectives are to analyze the spatial variation in orientation of the detected linear features and its relation to the hydrogeologic setting in the area and the underlying geology, and to evaluate the performance of the algorithm applied to the ETM+ and the DEM data. Detailed structural analysis and better understanding of the tectonic evolution of the area could provide useful tools for hydrologists for reliable groundwater management and development planning. The results obtained have been evaluated by the structural analysis of the area and field observations. Four major vertical fracture zones were detected corresponding to two conjugate sets of strike-slip faults that governed the surface, and subsurface environments of the lakes in the region, and these correlate well with the regional tectonics. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For reducing the atmospheric effect, a multivariate regression method is developed by combining the digital number (DN) of band 6 with the oceanic and atmospheric parameters that are geometric coordinate, water depth, air temperature, and aerological humidity in the SONDE data. High estimation accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated through cross-validation using the 220 in situ SST data. Seasonal change patterns of the SST in a year and also temporal changes from 1987 to 2000 are clarified by applying the method. The temporal change pattern of the SST is found to be similar to the precipitation within the last two months and also the air temperature except for Nov.2, 1997 data, which is probably affected by El Nino.},

abstract = {Simulating a rock fracture distribution is an important problem common to various fields in geosciences. This paper presents GEOFRAC, a geostatistical method to simulate a fracture distribution by incorporating the directions (strikes and dips) of the sampled fracture data into the simulation. Fracture locations are generated randomly following fracture densities assigned by a sequential Gaussian simulation. Fracture directions are transformed into an indicator set consisting of several binary (0 and 1) variables and the variables are compressed using the principal component analysis. Ordinary kriging is then employed to estimate the distributions of these principal values and the results are back-transformed into the coordinate system of the original indicator set. Fracture directions are generated randomly using their histograms within the defined directional interval. Finally, facets (fracture elements) are determined from the simulated locations and directions, and the fractures within the angle and distance tolerances are connected to form a fracture plane. From a case study of applying GEOFRAC to the fracture data in Kikuma granite, southwest Japan, GEOFRAC was shown to be able to depict a plausible fracture system because the simulated directions corresponded well to those measured. Furthermore, the simulated fracture system was available to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the study site, which was roughly in agreement with the average of hydraulic test results.},

In step (1), the shapes of upper and/or lower surface of the pyroclastic flow deposits and the andesitic lava were determined, whereas the three-dimensional distribution model of resistivity was constructed from resistivity logging data obtained from 100 boreholes and using the proposed interpolation method in the step (2). An empirical equation between the porosity and the resistivity of the lava was also identified.

Clarifying the spatial patterns of the metals in kuroko deposits will be useful for understanding their genetic mechanisms and for future exploration of such types of deposits. This study represents a spatial distribution analysis on the contents of principal metals of kuroko deposits: Cu, Pb, and Zn, in the Hokuroku district, northern Japan, by a feedforward neural network and 1917 sample data at 143 drillhole sites. The network, which consists of three layers, was trained by the principle of SLANS in which the numbers of neurons in the middle layer and training data are changed to improve estimation accuracy. Using the weight coefficients connecting adjacent neurons, sensitivity analysis of the neural network was carried out to identify factors influencing spatial distributions of the three metals. The coordinates depth (z) direction, Bouguer gravity, and specific lithology such as dacite were determined to be influencing factors. The high frequency of the z coordinate signifies that the metal contents differ to a large extent by depth. The sensitivity vector was defined using sensitivity coefficients for x, y, and z coordinates of an estimation point. We determined that the directions of large vectors were different inside and outside of the Hanawa-Ohdate area. This characteristic is considered to originate from the differences in the permeability of fractures that became the paths for rising ore solutions, and the depths that the solutions mixed with sea water.

abstract = {Geothermal reservoirs are usually located at a depth range of 2 to 5 km, so to efficiently utilize such resources an advanced prospecting method is needed to detect these deep geologic structures. This study aimed to three-dimensionally characterize geothermal reservoirs by a combination of Magnetotelluric (MT) survey, inversion analysis of apparent resistivity, and interpolation of the resistivity data obtained. The western side of Mt. Aso crater, southwest Japan, was chosen as the case study area. Three hot springs exist there and a fault is assumed to go in the direction connecting them. A MT survey was carried out at 26 sites and the data processed by a remote reference method to reduce artificial noises. Based on skewness and Mohr circle analyses of the impedance tensor, the local geologic structure at each site could be approximated as horizontally layered and therefore, a one-dimensional inversion analysis was applied to the MT raw data. The resultant resistivity column data were then interpolated by the three-dimensional optimization principle method. The resistivity distributions obtained clarified continuous conductors with especially low resistivity (less than 10 $\Omega$·m) at the hot springs along the fault. Because the resistivity decreases largely with an abundance of clay minerals, the conductors could be considered to correspond with the cap rocks. Thus, two geothermal reservoirs, whose shapes were estimated to be pillar, were detected under the cap rocks in an elevation range of - 1000 to - 3000 m. By comparing the resistivity distributions with the temperature distributions based on fluid-flow calculations at a steady state using FEM, the validity of the location and dimension of the estimated reservoirs were confirmed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The factors determining the suitability of limestone for industrial use and its commercial value are the amounts of calcium oxide (CaO) and impurities. From 244 sample points in 18 drillhole sites in a limestone mine, southwestern Japan, data on four impurity elements, SiO2, Fe2O3, MnO, and P2O5 were collected. It generally is difficult to estimate spatial distributions of these contents, because most of the limestone bodies in Japan are located in the accretionary complex lithologies of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age. Because the spatial correlations of content data are not clearly shown by variogram analysis, a feedforward neural network was applied to estimate the content distributions. The network structure consists of three layers: input, middle, and output. The input layer has 17 neurons and the output layer four. Three neurons in the input layer correspond with x, y, z coordinates of a sample point and the others are rock types such as crystalline and conglomeratic limestones, and fossil types related to the geologic age of the limestone. Four neurons in the output layer correspond to the amounts of SiO2, Fe2O3, MnO, and P2O5. Numbers of neurons in the middle layer and training data differ with each estimation point to avoid the overfitting of the network. We could detect several important characteristics of the three-dimensional content distributions through the network such as a continuity of low content zones of SiO2 along a Lower Permian fossil zone trending NE-SW, and low-quality zones located in depths shallower than 50 m. The capability of the neural network-based method compared with the geostatistical method is demonstrated from the viewpoints of estimation errors and spatial characteristics of multivariate data. To evaluate the uncertainty of estimates, a method that draws several outputs by changing coordinates slightly from the target point and inputting them to the same trained network is proposed. Uncertainty differs with impurity elements, and is not based on just the spatial arrangement of data points.},

abstract = {Assemblage of main fracture and subordinate fractures form a fracture zone. Geometry, orientation, and permeability of fracture zone are significant factors for exploration and assessment of geothermal resources. Because these fracture attributes, which have an effect on the hydrothermal system represented by flow pattern and physical condition of hot fluids, are difficult to be clarified on a field scale, a combination of several methods is required for the fracture-zone characterization. This paper presents a case study of this characterization on the Aso caldera in southwestern Japan. The study consists of the three parts, lineament analysis, numerical simulation, and geophysical survey. Lineaments are derived from SPOT panchromatic imagery and used to calculate azimuths and dips of the major fractures associated with the origin of hot springs. A numerical simulation using finite element method is aimed at estimating the configuration and permeability of the fracture zone, formed by a gathering of the major fractures. By this calculation, the fracture zone was inferred to consist of two prisms that incline at angles of 70?-80? in the opposite direction of the mountain slope, and have permeability, 102 greater than that of the country, volcanic rocks. Moreover, the radon survey using scintillation counter method and soil gas near the fumaroles has been conducted to investigate the temporal changes of radon concentrations at the three sites, located on the two prisms. A difference in the temporal change patterns among the sites may result from the physical conditions of the hydrothermal fluids ascending through the prisms.},

abstract = {Characterization of the sediment composition of tidal flats and monitoring of their spatiotemporal changes has become an important part of the sustainable management of coastal environments. To accurately classify sediments through remote sensing, a comprehensive understanding of sediment reflectance spectra is indispensable. The present laboratory-based study explores the performance of the high spatial resolution (10 × 10 m) Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) launched in 2006. Relationships between reflectance spectra (bands 1 to 4) and four typical mass physical properties were investigated under wet and dry experimental conditions for intertidal sediments sampled near the Ba Lat Estuary in northern Vietnam. Reflectance in the near-infrared region corresponding to ALOS band 4 (0.76–0.89 $\mu$m) was found (1) to have a strong negative correlation with sand content (dry wt\%) under both wet and dry conditions (linear correlation coefficient r = –0.7859 and –0.8094, respectively), (2) to increase with decreasing relative water content (\%) in a given sediment type (r = –0.7748 to –0.9367 for mud, sandy mud, muddy sand, and sand), (3) to have a positive correlation with organic matter content (r = 0.7610 and 0.6460 under wet and dry conditions for contents >0.20 dry wt\%), and (4) to be insignificantly correlated with mineral composition assessed in terms of contents (wt\%) of quartz, clay minerals, and mica group minerals. Positive relationships between reflectance and water content for the pooled data of all sediment types (r = 0.6395) or organic matter content contrast with previous findings, and can be attributed to close interrelationships between these properties and the predominance of sand content as controlling factor of reflectance. This study clarifies that ALOS band 4 provides the most useful imagery for intertidal monitoring because its reflectance, as simulated using the laboratory data, shows the strongest correlation with sand content. In a next step, these experimental findings should be verified by identifying the reflectance relationships at satellite image scales, and also considering the effects of other tidal flat features on reflectance, such as microtopography and biological surface characteristics.},

The general trends of LULC were detected by a satellite image classification technique and surface spline method, which highlighted the decreases in groundwater-recharge materials. As the next step, those trends of groundwater levels that were closely correlated with rainfall were removed from the level data set, and the resultant residual component levels were applied to co-kriging analysis with LULC categories. Co-kriging provided a detailed map of groundwater level variability. Furthermore, we propose a method, prediction of residual of groundwater level (PWL), to infer future residual groundwater levels from the supposed LULC pattern by co-kriging-based modeling.

The western side of Aso crater in southwest Japan was selected for a case study site, because two reservoirs were estimated by magnetotelluric survey. During two and half years, Rn concentrations have been measured continuously using the volcanic gases pumped from a borehole with 1 or 1.5-m depth and ionization chamber method. Periodic measurements of Rn and Tn (radon-220) by scintillation counter method, and six chemical components data (He, H2, O2, N2, CH4, and CO2) by gas chromatography have been added at one-week intervals. The Rn concentrations by the periodic measurements at the three sites located in the 2-km range clarified the similarity of general fluctuation patterns, which implies an existence of common factor for reservoir condition changes. Because the continuous Rn data at one site were influenced by the atmospheric temperatures, residual components were obtained by subtracting the trend components from the original data. The chemical component data were used to estimate the temperature and pressure in reservoir: resultant temperature range was 230 to 285 C and average pressure was 80 MPa. Main factor for producing these changes is probably volcanic seismicity. It was clarified that the residual Rn components correspond generally with the temporal changes of the estimated temperatures and pressures. Average temperatures at the other two sites were estimated as 265 and 304 C. The differences in the value and changeability of the temperatures may be attributable to source depth of volcanic gases.},

This trend requires a more precise estimation of available Ni grade deposits and an identification of factors controlling the grade distribution. To achieve these requirements, this study applies geostatistical techniques to spatial modeling of the Ni grade in a laterite Ni deposit, with reference to geomorphic features such as slope gradient and the thickness of limonite and saprolite zones. The Sorowako area in Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, was chosen as a case study area because it has a representative laterite Ni deposit with large reserves. Chemical content data from drillhole cores at 294 points were used for the analysis. The slope gradient was found to have a remarkable correlation with the thickness of the limonite zone, but there was no correlation between the thickness of the limonite and the saprolite zones above the bedrock. One important feature was a general correlation between the thickness of the saprolite zone and the maximum Ni grade in this zone: the grade increases with the thickness of the zone. Co-kriging was adopted to incorporate this correlation into estimating the maximum Ni grade in the saprolite zone. As a result, the maximum Ni grade in the saprolite zone tends to be high mainly in areas of slight slope. The Ni accumulation at this topographic feature probably originates from deep weathering by groundwater infiltrating through well-developed rock fractures.},

abstract = {An understanding of fracture systems in geological media requires two fracture properties clarification: fracture distributions and the scaling law of fracture systems over different scales. To investigate fracture systems in different scales, we used remotely sensed images from LANDSAT and SPOT satellites, borehole-fracture data in two drilling directions, and a thin-section of rock core sample. The eastern part of the Tohoku district, northeastern Japan, overlain by Cretaceous granite and a Jurassic accretionary complex, was chosen as the study area. Assuming that part of the line features detected in satellite and thin-section images correspond with real fractures, the spatial correlation structures of fractures were clarified by semivariograms to identify an alternative scaling law. For this we focused on joint's line density along boreholes, area density of linear features, and directional relations of strikes between a fracture pair to produce semivariograms of densities and cross-semivariograms of the strikes transformed into binary data sets. The same model independent of the scales could approximate the semivariograms of each parameter. Spatial correlation distances were obtained from the range of the semivariogram model. An important characteristic was that linear trends between representative and correlation distances of fractures were found in log-log plots. Scaling law can contribute to estimating correlation distances at arbitrary fracture scales. A conditional distribution modeling at the borehole-fracture scale was presented as an application of the semivariograms obtained by the three steps: generation of fracture-density map by a sequential gaussian simulation, assignment of strikes to each simulated fracture, and connection of fractures considering distances and differences in strikes between a closely located fracture pair. Additionally, nonconditional simulation at arbitrary fracture scales and changes of permeabilities with scales using a permeability tensor analysis are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to identify the mechanism of groundwater As contamination in relation to leaching and oxidation along the border between the South Minahasa and Bolaang Mongondow districts, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. This region contains Miocene sedimentary rock-hosted disseminated gold deposits associated with hydrothermal alteration in a fault zone. Abnormally high As concentrations were observed in hot and cold springs and in surrounding shallow groundwater for a total mineralization area of 8 × 10 km2. Two methods were adopted in this study: (1) microscopic and spectroscopic analyses of rock samples for mineral identification and (2) geostatistics for spatial modeling of As concentrations in groundwater. Jarosite was identified as the chief fill mineral in rock defects (cracks and pores). The presence of this mineral may indicate release of As into the environment, as can occur as an alteration product derived from oxidation and leaching of pyrite, As-rich pyrite or sulfide minerals by geothermal waters. Moreover, As concentrations in groundwater were estimated using geostatistics for spatial modeling. The co-kriging map identified local anomalies in groundwater As concentrations over the permissible limit (10 ppb). Such anomalies did not appear through ordinary kriging. Integration of the results indicates that As contamination in shallow groundwater probably is controlled by heterogeneous distributions of jarosite and variations in intensity and extent of hydrothermal activities.},

abstract = {Environmental studies require multivariate data such as chemical concentrations with space-time coordinates. There are two general conditions related to such data: the existence of correlations among the coregionalized variables and the differences in numbers of data which occur because of insufficient data caused by measurement error or bad weather conditions. This study proposes geostatistical techniques for space-time multivariate modeling that take into consideration these correlations and data absences. These techniques consist of suitable modeling of semivariograms and cross-semivariograms for quantifying correlation structures among multivariables and of extending standardized ordinary cokriging. The tensor product cubic smoothing surface method is used for space-time semivariogram modeling. These methods are applied to the chemical component data of the Ariake Sea, a typical closed sea in southwest Japan. In order to clarify environmental changes in the Ariake Sea, the concentration data of four nutritive salts (NO2–N, NO3–N, NH4–N, and PO4–P) at 38 stations over 25 years are used as environmental indicators. For each of the kinds of data, there are spaces and times for which there is no data available. The effectiveness of the modeling of space-time semivariograms and the high estimation capability of the extended cokriging are demonstrated by cross-validation.

abstract = {Regional fault patterns contribute important information for preliminary exploration for mineralized areas and characterization of geologic structure. Faults may correspond with lineaments appearing on remotely sensed images. In this paper, a new lineament identification method, namely the Segment Tracing Algorithm (STA), is proposed, and its application in mountainous areas of southwestern Japan is discussed. The principle of the STA is to detect a line of pixels as a vector element by examining local variance of the gray level in the digital image, and to connect retained line elements along their expected directions. The threshold values for the extraction and the linkage of line elements are direction dependent. The advantages of the proposed method over usual filtering methods are its capability to (1) trace only continuous valleys and (2) extract more lineaments that parallel the sun's azimuth and those located in shadow areas. A LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) subscene was used for the analysis. The band 4 subscene of the LANDSAT TM image was determined to be appropriate for the lineament analysis by comparing several images with a shaded-relief image derived from a digital elevation model (DEM).},

abstract = {Preservation of the amount and quality of groundwater resources is an important issue around the world. Changes in groundwater levels need to be monitored in efforts to preserve groundwater. This study investigates suitable methods to characterize changes in the groundwater level and determine the factors involved. The area of Kumamoto, a city in central Kyushu, southwest Japan, was selected to demonstrate the usefulness of the methods because this area is one of the richest in Japan in terms of groundwater resources and takes all its water from groundwater. Data of the groundwater level recorded at 69 wells from 1979 to 2007 were used in geostatistical and correlogram analyses. First, strong correlation between the topography and groundwater level was identified. Incorporating this correlation into spatial modeling of the groundwater level, co-kriging was demonstrated to be more accurate than ordinary kriging. The co-kriging results clarified the hydraulic characteristics of the Kumamoto area; the patterns of shallow and deep groundwater levels were agreeable generally, and the general trends of their annual average levels were similar regardless of precipitation. Another important feature was that the correlograms for the precipitation amount and groundwater level had a constant shape and changed smoothly with a change in lag time regardless of the precipitation only in the area of Togawa lava. These characteristics are probably due to the connections between shallow and deep aquifers and the high permeability of Togawa lava.},

abstract = {An interpolation method based on a multilayer neural network (MNN), has been examined and tested for the data of irregular sample locations. The main advantage of MNN is in that it can deal with geoscience data with nonlinear behavior and extract characteristics from complex and noisy images. The training of MNN is used to modify connection weights between nodes located in different layers by a simulated annealing algorithm (one of the optimization algorithms of the network). In this process, three types of errors are considered: differences in values, semivariograms, and gradients between sample data and outputs from the trained network. The training is continued until the summation of these errors converges to an acceptably small value. Because the MNN trained by this learning criterion can estimate a value at an arbitrary location, this method is a form of kriging and termed Neural Kriging (NK). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of NK, a problem on restoration ability of a defined reference surface from randomly chosen discrete data was prepared. Two types of surfaces, whose semivariograms are expressed by isotropic spherical and geometric anisotropic gaussian models, were examined in this problem. Though the interpolation accuracy depended on the arrangement pattern of the sample locations for the same number of data, the interpolation errors of NK were shown to be smaller than both those of ordinary MNN and ordinal kriging. NK can also produce a contour map in consideration of gradient constraints. Furthermore, NK was applied to distribution analysis of subsurface temperatures using geothermal investigation loggings of the Hohi area in southwest Japan. In spite of the restricted quantity of sample data, the interpolation results revealed high temperature zones and convection patterns of hydrothermal fluids. NK is regarded as an interpolation method with high accuracy that can be used for regionalized variables with any structure of spatial correlation.},

Although it is highly probable that geological faults in coastal areas affect groundwater flow patterns, the effect has not been described yet in detail. This study is aimed at detecting and imaging groundwater flow and its temporal change around a fault in a coastal area through resistivity and chargeability distributions using electrical sounding. The Okoshiki area in central Kyushu, southwest Japan, was selected as a case study area, because of the presence of Kamiouda Fault. The measurements were conducted along six lines of both parallel and perpendicular orientations to the coastline. A feature suggesting a fault zone was evident on two lines. Through the temporal change of resistivity, movement and mixing processes of the seawater and freshwater during the ebb, low and flood tides were interpreted. A conceptual model of the processes was constructed in which a fault zone and the configuration of bedrock are dominant elements by acting as a selective path and a barrier to the groundwater flow, respectively.},

abstract = {Arsenic (As) contamination in groundwater in mineralized areas typically results from the oxidation of As-rich sulfide minerals in aquifers, from hydrothermal alteration of geothermal systems, or as a result of anthropogenic influences such as mining activity. The primary goal of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal variance in As concentrations in shallow groundwater in a mineralized area and to identify the main As source controlling the concentration patterns. To this end, a combination of a geostatistical technique for space–time modeling of As concentrations and a numerical simulation, which models the transport of As in groundwater, is implemented. A study site in North Sulawesi, Sulawesi Island, Indonesia was selected as it was suitable for investigating the importance of fault lines and metal mining on As contamination. Initially, stable isotope analysis was used to ascertain the groundwater source and the mixing mechanism of the shallow and deep groundwater. Geostatistical modeling revealed consistent general patterns of As concentrations during the past 10 years, with high concentrations found along a NW–SE axis. By matching the geostatistical results with the distributions of As concentrations obtained through transport modeling, the deep-seated hydrothermal system along the fault zone was found to be the major As source. Wastewater from the mine was also observed to be a local As source. Another important influence on the As concentration pattern was a river, which acted as a boundary to separate the groundwater systems into two regions.},

abstract = {A combination of satellite-data processing and geostatistical spatial modeling is examined to investigate long-term changes in groundwater levels within a catchment basin and identify the causes of the changes. The data processing was used to obtain an accurate image classification of land covers while the geostatistical modeling was used to interpolate residual components of groundwater levels by removing identified trends from the original data. Our case study focused on the Kumamoto Plain, situated in central Kyushu, southwest Japan, where all of the water supply is derived from groundwater. A Linear Spectral Mixture was adopted to the 10 sub-scene images of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhancement Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors covering the study area for a 16-year period (1987-2003); this proved to be highly effective in detecting declining amounts of groundwater-recharging material. Descriptive statistical parameters from the groundwater-level data were integrated with the process of identifying, characterizing, and removing the trend components that are closely correlated with rainfall. Variogram modeling and ordinary kriging were used to construct a spatial model of the residual groundwater-level data. Finally, a multivariate model is proposed to estimate the degree of reduction in groundwater levels. The correlation coefficients between the observed and estimated residual levels by the multivariate regression model at 14 wells for the cross-validation range from 0.95 to 0.98. This demonstrates the applicability of the model to both the local areas around well sites and across the entire study area. To deepen the regression result, the Tukey honestly significantly different statistical test was applied. The test clarified that changes in land cover from rice field to urban areas have the greatest impact on reductions in groundwater within the recharge area. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to characterize in detail the temporal changes in Rn (radon-222) concentration in soil gases near fumaroles and clarify its correlation with volcanic earthquakes and temperatures in two geothermal reservoirs. Mt. Aso crater in southwest Japan, which has two reservoirs on its western side estimated by magnetotelluric survey to be at about 2km in depth, was selected for this study. For the long-term survey, the $\alpha$ scintillation counter method was used weekly for 12.5years at the three hot springs within a 2-km range. Rn concentrations were calculated using the CRAS method, a calculation method that considers radioactive equilibrium or nonequilibrium state of the soil gas. Rn concentrations generally showed similar fluctuation patterns among the sites. CRAS was used as a new indicator for evaluating the age of the soil gas. This age corresponds to the elapsed time determined from the generation of Rn based on the measurement of the numbers of atoms of Rn and its daughter 218Po at the start of measurement. In comparing the Rn data with the history of earthquakes in the Aso caldera, volcanic seismicity was identified as a major controlling factor in the sudden increase and decrease in Rn concentration as a function of age. For more precise detections of change, Rn concentrations were measured continuously at one site by pumping soil gas from a borehole and using an ionization chamber over 2.5years. Five chemical components (He, H2, N2, CH4, and CO2) were then measured by gas chromatography at 1-week intervals. Because Rn concentrations are affected strongly by atmospheric temperatures, the residual components were obtained by subtracting the trend of the components from the original data. Chemical component data were used to estimate the temperature and pressure in the reservoir at the site; temperatures ranged from 229 to 280°C, (average 265°C, average pressure 80MPa). Residual Rn concentrations showed a clear correlation with temporal changes in estimated temperature and, to a degree, with pressure. Considering the migration mechanism of Rn by molecular diffusion and advection under rapid gas upflow conditions, change in the diffusion coefficient is regarded as a possible factor to have induced temporal changes in Rn concentrations in conjunction with the temperature changes in the reservoirs. In addition, the increase of the amount of degassed Rn from the advective-convective hydrothermal fluids, which is associated with wall-rock fracturing, is another important factor. Earthquakes likely enhance the permeability of a reservoir by generating fractures, which in turn can cause an increase in the reservoir temperature, upflow fluid velocity, and gas flux. This provides one possible interpretation for the significant correlation of Rn concentrations with earthquakes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This report presents several methods that are grouped into two categories depending on the natures of geologic data: type I for the data originated from plural populations and type II for the data that can be applied to the prerequisite of stationarity and have distinct spatial correlations. For the type I data, a spline-based method, its combination with stochastic simulation, and neural network method are demonstrated as effective, while geostatistics is certainly powerful tool for the type II data. As new approaches of geostatistics, an application to directional data such as fracture, multi-scale modeling that incorporates a scaling law, and space-time joint analysis for multivariate are reviewed briefly with case studies. These methods can contribute to Earth science and technology including rock engineering related to the problems such as repository of high-level nuclear waste and CCS (carbon dioxide capture and storage) which need the most comprehensive understandings of rock structures and properties.},

abstract = {Precise spatial estimation of ore grades and impurity contents from sample data limited in amount and location is indispensable to metallic and nonmetallic resource exploration. One of the advantages of using geostatistics for this purpose is that it can incorporate multivariate data into spatial estimation of one variable. However, there are two weak points concerning technical and post-processing problems. First is the difficulty in application to geologic data in which spatial correlations are not clear because of intrinsic nonlinear behavior. Second is the absence of indices to interpret the mechanisms and factors which govern the spatial distribution. To address these problems, a spatial method of modeling based on a feedforward neural network, SLANS, which recognizes the relationship between the data value and location by considering supplementary attributes such as lithology and biostratigraphy, and a sensitivity analysis using this network were developed. These methods were applied to two case studies, genetic mechanisms of kuroko deposits and quality assessment of a limestone mine. The first case study is a spatial analysis of principal metals of kuroko deposits (volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits) in the Hokuroku district, northern Japan. It was clarified that upward and downward sensitivity vectors were distinguished near the deposits inside and outside the tectonic basin, respectively. Sensitivity analysis for the second case study showed a strong effect of crystalline limestone on the important impurity, P2O5 contents. Hydrothermal alteration, which could cause leaching and secondary concentration of phosphorus, is considered to have produced this effect.},

abstract = {Mt. Merapi, Indonesia, is one of the most active and dangerous volcanoes in the Torrid Zone. This volcano has erupted frequently and has produced pyroclastic flows following the collapse of the summit lava dome. We used Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by JERS-1 and RADARSAT-1 satellites from April 1996 to July 2006 to clarify the distribution patterns of the pyroclastic flow deposits. The extent of the deposits, termed P-zones, was accurately extracted by ratio operation and low-level feature extraction from SAR intensity images. These images highlighted temporal changes of the distribution area, perimeter, flow distance, included angle, and collapse direction. To validate the image-processing results, reflectance spectra of the rock samples collected after the eruption in June 2006 were measured in a laboratory. The reflectance spectra of all samples showed similar characteristics to the reference spectra, which were derived from atmospheric correction of Hyperion sensor image data covering the lava dome at the summit. Therefore, P-zones were confirmed to be the pyroclastic flow deposits originating from destruction of the lava dome at the summit. The image-processing results clarified that the extent of the distribution areas, perimeter, flow distances, and included angle of the P-zones were variable among the eruptions, while the collapse direction had a constant pattern. The collapse pattern followed a clockwise change from the south toward the west. By comparing the ratio maps of Bouguer gravity anomaly data in two periods, the change was interpreted to originate from the inclination of the conduit and the formation of shallow and deep magma reservoirs.},

abstract = {The Hokuroku district, extending over 40 × 40 km2 in northern Japan, is known to be dominated by kuroko-type massive sulfide deposits that have a genetic relation to submarine volcanic activity. The deposits are hosted in a specific stratigraphic zone of Miocene volcanic rocks. Because kuroko-type deposits are under exploration in several countries, it is important to integrate the geologic and geochemical data that have been accumulated in the Hokuroku district to characterize the distribution of deposits and produce a map of mineral potential. Thus, we collected data on multiple chemical components from 1917 rock cores at 143 drillhole sites and concentrated on components with relatively large amounts of data, which are SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 as major elements and Cu, Pb, and Zn as trace elements. Although frequencies of these data can be approximated by normal or lognormal distributions, spatial correlation structures cannot be extracted from the semivariograms of each component nor from the cross-semivariograms between two components of the major or minor elements. To handle such complexity, a spatial method of modeling content distribution, SLANS, is developed by applying a feedforward neural network. The principle of SLANS is to train a network repeatedly to recognize the relation between the data value and the location and lithology of a sample point. One-hundred outputs for each element are obtained by changing the numbers of neurons in a middle layer from 1 to 10 and sample data used for training from 3 to 12, and finally one output is selected based on the estimation precision of the network which is restricted near the target point. After constructing a geologic distribution model from the geological column classified into 25 rock codes, three-dimensional distributions of Cu, Pb, and Zn contents are estimated over the study area. The content models are considered to be valid because high-content zones are located on the known mine sites and the margins of ancient volcanoes or calderas. Some zones are distributed along strikes of major deep-seated fractures in the district.},
