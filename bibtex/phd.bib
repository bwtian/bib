abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an important technique in the exploration of geothermal resources. In this study, a geothermal survey is conducted in Tengchong area of Yunnan province in China using TIR data from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor. Based on radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and emissivity calculation, a simple but efficient single channel algorithm with acceptable precision is applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of study area. The LST anomalous areas with temperature about 4-10 K higher than background area are discovered. Four geothermal areas are identified with the discussion of geothermal mechanism and the further analysis of regional geologic structure. The research reveals that the distribution of geothermal areas is consistent with the fault development in study area. Magmatism contributes abundant thermal source to study area and the faults provide thermal channels for heat transfer from interior earth to land surface and facilitate the present of geothermal anomalies. Finally, we conclude that TIR remote sensing is a cost-effective technique to detect LST anomalies. Combining TIR remote sensing with geological analysis and the understanding of geothermal mechanism is an accurate and efficient approach to geothermal area detection. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to clarify the sensitivity and estimation accuracy of Rn (radon-222) for the change of physical properties, in special temperature and pressure, in geothermal reservoirs. The western side of Aso crater in southwest Japan was selected for a case study site, because two reservoirs were estimated by magnetotelluric survey. During two and half years, Rn concentrations have been measured continuously using the volcanic gases pumped from a borehole with 1 or 1.5-m depth and ionization chamber method. Periodic measurements of Rn and Tn (radon-220) by scintillation counter method, and six chemical components data (He, H2, O2, N2, CH4, and CO2) by gas chromatography have been added at one-week intervals. The Rn concentrations by the periodic measurements at the three sites located in the 2-km range clarified the similarity of general fluctuation patterns, which implies an existence of common factor for reservoir condition changes. Because the continuous Rn data at one site were influenced by the atmospheric temperatures, residual components were obtained by subtracting the trend components from the original data. The chemical component data were used to estimate the temperature and pressure in reservoir: resultant temperature range was 230 to 285 C and average pressure was 80 MPa. Main factor for producing these changes is probably volcanic seismicity. It was clarified that the residual Rn components correspond generally with the temporal changes of the estimated temperatures and pressures. Average temperatures at the other two sites were estimated as 265 and 304 C. The differences in the value and changeability of the temperatures may be attributable to source depth of volcanic gases.},

abstract = {Due to growing consumption of nickel (Ni) in a range of industries, the demand for Ni has increased rapidly around the world. This trend requires a more precise estimation of available Ni grade deposits and an identification of factors controlling the grade distribution. To achieve these requirements, this study applies geostatistical techniques to spatial modeling of the Ni grade in a laterite Ni deposit, with reference to geomorphic features such as slope gradient and the thickness of limonite and saprolite zones. The Sorowako area in Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, was chosen as a case study area because it has a representative laterite Ni deposit with large reserves. Chemical content data from drillhole cores at 294 points were used for the analysis. The slope gradient was found to have a remarkable correlation with the thickness of the limonite zone, but there was no correlation between the thickness of the limonite and the saprolite zones above the bedrock. One important feature was a general correlation between the thickness of the saprolite zone and the maximum Ni grade in this zone: the grade increases with the thickness of the zone. Co-kriging was adopted to incorporate this correlation into estimating the maximum Ni grade in the saprolite zone. As a result, the maximum Ni grade in the saprolite zone tends to be high mainly in areas of slight slope. The Ni accumulation at this topographic feature probably originates from deep weathering by groundwater infiltrating through well-developed rock fractures.},

abstract = {An understanding of fracture systems in geological media requires two fracture properties clarification: fracture distributions and the scaling law of fracture systems over different scales. To investigate fracture systems in different scales, we used remotely sensed images from LANDSAT and SPOT satellites, borehole-fracture data in two drilling directions, and a thin-section of rock core sample. The eastern part of the Tohoku district, northeastern Japan, overlain by Cretaceous granite and a Jurassic accretionary complex, was chosen as the study area. Assuming that part of the line features detected in satellite and thin-section images correspond with real fractures, the spatial correlation structures of fractures were clarified by semivariograms to identify an alternative scaling law. For this we focused on joint's line density along boreholes, area density of linear features, and directional relations of strikes between a fracture pair to produce semivariograms of densities and cross-semivariograms of the strikes transformed into binary data sets. The same model independent of the scales could approximate the semivariograms of each parameter. Spatial correlation distances were obtained from the range of the semivariogram model. An important characteristic was that linear trends between representative and correlation distances of fractures were found in log-log plots. Scaling law can contribute to estimating correlation distances at arbitrary fracture scales. A conditional distribution modeling at the borehole-fracture scale was presented as an application of the semivariograms obtained by the three steps: generation of fracture-density map by a sequential gaussian simulation, assignment of strikes to each simulated fracture, and connection of fractures considering distances and differences in strikes between a closely located fracture pair. Additionally, nonconditional simulation at arbitrary fracture scales and changes of permeabilities with scales using a permeability tensor analysis are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Leaching and oxidation of high arsenic (As) host rocks tend to be induced by circulation of deep geothermal waters, which increase As concentration in shallow groundwater. The purpose of this study is to identify the mechanism of groundwater As contamination in relation to leaching and oxidation along the border between the South Minahasa and Bolaang Mongondow districts, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. This region contains Miocene sedimentary rock-hosted disseminated gold deposits associated with hydrothermal alteration in a fault zone. Abnormally high As concentrations were observed in hot and cold springs and in surrounding shallow groundwater for a total mineralization area of 8 × 10 km2. Two methods were adopted in this study: (1) microscopic and spectroscopic analyses of rock samples for mineral identification and (2) geostatistics for spatial modeling of As concentrations in groundwater. Jarosite was identified as the chief fill mineral in rock defects (cracks and pores). The presence of this mineral may indicate release of As into the environment, as can occur as an alteration product derived from oxidation and leaching of pyrite, As-rich pyrite or sulfide minerals by geothermal waters. Moreover, As concentrations in groundwater were estimated using geostatistics for spatial modeling. The co-kriging map identified local anomalies in groundwater As concentrations over the permissible limit (10 ppb). Such anomalies did not appear through ordinary kriging. Integration of the results indicates that As contamination in shallow groundwater probably is controlled by heterogeneous distributions of jarosite and variations in intensity and extent of hydrothermal activities.},

abstract = {Environmental studies require multivariate data such as chemical concentrations with space-time coordinates. There are two general conditions related to such data: the existence of correlations among the coregionalized variables and the differences in numbers of data which occur because of insufficient data caused by measurement error or bad weather conditions. This study proposes geostatistical techniques for space-time multivariate modeling that take into consideration these correlations and data absences. These techniques consist of suitable modeling of semivariograms and cross-semivariograms for quantifying correlation structures among multivariables and of extending standardized ordinary cokriging. The tensor product cubic smoothing surface method is used for space-time semivariogram modeling. These methods are applied to the chemical component data of the Ariake Sea, a typical closed sea in southwest Japan. In order to clarify environmental changes in the Ariake Sea, the concentration data of four nutritive salts (NO2–N, NO3–N, NH4–N, and PO4–P) at 38 stations over 25 years are used as environmental indicators. For each of the kinds of data, there are spaces and times for which there is no data available. The effectiveness of the modeling of space-time semivariograms and the high estimation capability of the extended cokriging are demonstrated by cross-validation. Compared with ordinary kriging for a single variable, multivariate space-time standardized ordinary cokriging can provide a more detailed concentration map of nutritive salts and while elucidating their temporal changes over sparsely spaced data areas. In the space-time models by ordinary kriging, on the other hand, smooth trends are obvious.},

abstract = {This paper presents a summary of a laboratory and field research program designed to evaluate the application of remote sensing techniques to geothermal exploration and development. The primary objective was to establish the feasibility of performing initial reconnaissance of an unmapped area with airborne or spacecraft remote sensors. The field experiments were conducted against a series of known geothermal regions in California. These regions were chosen to represent a typical range of geologic and environmental settings. It was attempted to relate remotely sensed and in-situ geophysical measurements of representative geothermal regions through a diurnal and seasonal range of variation. Effects of varying flight altitude on thermal anomaly « signatures \aa are also presented. Multiband photography in the visible and near infra-red was used to delineate anomalous spectral reflectance associated with hydrothermal alteration zones, passive \{\{IR\}\} imagery and radiometry in the 8 to 14 $\mu$ band, as well as passive microwave radiometry at 16 and 19 \{\{GHz\}\} was used to detect combined temperature and emissivity anomalies. Preliminary laboratory studies of field samples served to define the sensor passbands to be employed and permit later interpretation of observed effects. Ground controls on the experiment included detailed thermometric, gravity, magnetic and subsurface heat flow mapping. The major results of this investigation may be summarized as the identification of temperature anomalies in not only the infrared; but also the microwave, Rayleigh-Jeans region of the spectrum. Subsidiary conclusions were the uniform presence of visible alteration haloes, soil moisture anomalies, and apparent structural control of the thermal zones. While these techniques were applied in the nature of a controlled experiment, the results are considered generally applicable to related problems of geologic reconnaissance.},

abstract = {Visible near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has long been used for geothermal exploration. Specific focus on the TIR region (8-12. $\mu$m) has resulted in major-rock-forming mineral classes being identified and their areal percentages to be more easily mapped due in part to the linear mixing behavior of TIR emission. To understand the mineral compositional and thermal distribution of active geothermal surfaces systems, hyperspectral TIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) airborne sensor were acquired over the Salton Sea, CA geothermal fields by The Aerospace Corporation on March 26, 2009 and April 6, 2010. SEBASS collects 128 wavelength channels at \~{}. 1. m spatial resolution. Such high resolution data are rarely available for this type of scientific analysis and enabled the identification of rare mineral assemblages associated with the geothermally-active areas. One surface unit with a unique spectrum, believed to be a magnesium sulfate of unknown hydration state, was identified for the first time in the SEBASS data. The abundance and distribution of this mineral varied between 2009 and 2010 likely due to the precipitation conditions. Data obtained by the SEBASS sensor were also regressed to the 32 channel spectral resolution of the Mineral and Gas Identifier (MAGI) airborne sensor in order to test sensitivity limits. At this lower spectral resolution, all surface minerals were still effectively identified and therefore validated data at MAGI resolution are still very effective for accurate surface compositional mapping. A similar approach used at active geothermal areas in other semi-arid regions around the world has the potential to better characterize transient mineralogy, identify "indicators minerals", understand the influence of surface and ground water, and ultimately to locate new geothermal targets for future exploration. Furthermore, new Mineral and Gas Identification (MAGI) data serve as an excellent precursor for future spaceborne TIR data such as the system proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) instrument. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Remote sensing is a component of the current geothermal monitoring plan. Landsat satellite data have a substantial historical archive and will continue to be collected into the future, making it the only available thermal imagery for histori- cal analysis and long-term monitoring of geothermal areas in the entirety of YNP. Landsat imagery from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors was used to examine change trajectories for terrestrial emittance among spatial groupings from 1986 to 2007. Trajectories of locations with known change events were also examined. Relationships between the spatial groupings and several change vectors (distance to geologic faults, distance to large water bodies, and distance to earthquake swarms) were explored. The analysis showed the stron- gest relationship between absolute difference in terrestrial emittance and earthquake swarms, with 34\% of the variation explained. Certain known change events were reflected in the change trajectories, while the Landsat imagery was not able to detect other known events. This suggests that Landsat imagery might be a useful tool for monitoring geothermal responses in YNP, but cannot be expected to suffice as the sole monitoring tool.},

Faults may correspond with lineaments appearing on remotely sensed images. In this paper, a new lineament identification method, namely the Segment Tracing Algorithm (STA), is proposed, and its application in mountainous areas of southwestern Japan is discussed. The principle of the STA is to detect a line of pixels as a vector element by examining local variance of the gray level in the digital image, and to connect retained line elements along their expected directions. The threshold values for the extraction and the linkage of line elements are direction dependent. The advantages of the proposed method over usual filtering methods are its capability to (1) trace only continuous valleys and (2) extract more lineaments that parallel the sun's azimuth and those located in shadow areas. A LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) subscene was used for the analysis. The band 4 subscene of the LANDSAT TM image was determined to be appropriate for the lineament analysis by comparing several images with a shaded-relief image derived from a digital elevation model (DEM).},

This study investigates suitable methods to characterize changes in the groundwater level and determine the factors involved. The area of Kumamoto, a city in central Kyushu, southwest Japan, was selected to demonstrate the usefulness of the methods because this area is one of the richest in Japan in terms of groundwater resources and takes all its water from groundwater. Data of the groundwater level recorded at 69 wells from 1979 to 2007 were used in geostatistical and correlogram analyses. First, strong correlation between the topography and groundwater level was identified. Incorporating this correlation into spatial modeling of the groundwater level, co-kriging was demonstrated to be more accurate than ordinary kriging. The co-kriging results clarified the hydraulic characteristics of the Kumamoto area; the patterns of shallow and deep groundwater levels were agreeable generally, and the general trends of their annual average levels were similar regardless of precipitation. Another important feature was that the correlograms for the precipitation amount and groundwater level had a constant shape and changed smoothly with a change in lag time regardless of the precipitation only in the area of Togawa lava. These characteristics are probably due to the connections between shallow and deep aquifers and the high permeability of Togawa lava.},

abstract = {The reconstruction of the stratigraphical-structural framework and the hydrogeology of geothermal areas is fundamental for understanding the relationships between cap rocks, reservoir and circulation of geothermal fluids and for planning the exploitation of the field. The Cerro Tuzgle-Tocomar geothermal volcanic area (Puna plateau, Central Andes, NW Argentina) has a high geothermal potential. It is crossed by the active NW-SE trans-Andean tectonic lineament known as the Calama-Olacapato-Toro (COT) fault system, which favours a high secondary permeability testified by the presence of numerous springs. This study presents new stratigraphic and hydrogeological data on the geothermal field, together with the analysis from remote sensed image analysis of morphostructural evidences associated with the structural framework and active tectonics. Our data suggest that the main geothermal reservoir is located within or below the Pre-Palaeozoic-Ordovician basement units, characterised by unevenly distributed secondary permeability. The reservoir is recharged by infiltration in the ridges above 4500. m. a.s.l., where basement rocks are in outcrop. Below 4500. m. a.s.l., the reservoir is covered by the low permeable Miocene-Quaternary units that allow a poor circulation of shallow groundwater. Geothermal fluids upwell in areas with more intense fracturing, especially where main regional structures, particularly NW-SE COT-parallel lineaments, intersect with secondary structures, such as at the Tocomar field. Away from the main tectonic features, such as at the Cerro Tuzgle field, the less developed network of faults and fractures allows only a moderate upwelling of geothermal fluids and a mixing between hot and shallow cold waters. The integration of field-based and remote-sensing analyses at the Cerro Tuzgle-Tocomar area proved to be effective in approaching the prospection of remote geothermal fields, and in defining the conceptual model for geothermal circulation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present the first quantitative representation of the intensity of Yellowstone National Park's surficial geothermal activity mapped continuously in space. A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km2 landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0??W m- 2 up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94??W m- 2 (at the 28.5??m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r = 0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone's famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {An interpolation method based on a multilayer neural network (MNN), has been examined and tested for the data of irregular sample locations. The main advantage of MNN is in that it can deal with geoscience data with nonlinear behavior and extract characteristics from complex and noisy images. The training of MNN is used to modify connection weights between nodes located in different layers by a simulated annealing algorithm (one of the optimization algorithms of the network). In this process, three types of errors are considered: differences in values, semivariograms, and gradients between sample data and outputs from the trained network. The training is continued until the summation of these errors converges to an acceptably small value. Because the MNN trained by this learning criterion can estimate a value at an arbitrary location, this method is a form of kriging and termed Neural Kriging (NK). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of NK, a problem on restoration ability of a defined reference surface from randomly chosen discrete data was prepared. Two types of surfaces, whose semivariograms are expressed by isotropic spherical and geometric anisotropic gaussian models, were examined in this problem. Though the interpolation accuracy depended on the arrangement pattern of the sample locations for the same number of data, the interpolation errors of NK were shown to be smaller than both those of ordinary MNN and ordinal kriging. NK can also produce a contour map in consideration of gradient constraints. Furthermore, NK was applied to distribution analysis of subsurface temperatures using geothermal investigation loggings of the Hohi area in southwest Japan. In spite of the restricted quantity of sample data, the interpolation results revealed high temperature zones and convection patterns of hydrothermal fluids. NK is regarded as an interpolation method with high accuracy that can be used for regionalized variables with any structure of spatial correlation.},

Although it is highly probable that geological faults in coastal areas affect groundwater flow patterns, the effect has not been described yet in detail. This study is aimed at detecting and imaging groundwater flow and its temporal change around a fault in a coastal area through resistivity and chargeability distributions using electrical sounding. The Okoshiki area in central Kyushu, southwest Japan, was selected as a case study area, because of the presence of Kamiouda Fault. The measurements were conducted along six lines of both parallel and perpendicular orientations to the coastline. A feature suggesting a fault zone was evident on two lines. Through the temporal change of resistivity, movement and mixing processes of the seawater and freshwater during the ebb, low and flood tides were interpreted. A conceptual model of the processes was constructed in which a fault zone and the configuration of bedrock are dominant elements by acting as a selective path and a barrier to the groundwater flow, respectively.},

abstract = {Arsenic (As) contamination in groundwater in mineralized areas typically results from the oxidation of As-rich sulfide minerals in aquifers, from hydrothermal alteration of geothermal systems, or as a result of anthropogenic influences such as mining activity. The primary goal of this study was to determine the spatial and temporal variance in As concentrations in shallow groundwater in a mineralized area and to identify the main As source controlling the concentration patterns. To this end, a combination of a geostatistical technique for space–time modeling of As concentrations and a numerical simulation, which models the transport of As in groundwater, is implemented. A study site in North Sulawesi, Sulawesi Island, Indonesia was selected as it was suitable for investigating the importance of fault lines and metal mining on As contamination. Initially, stable isotope analysis was used to ascertain the groundwater source and the mixing mechanism of the shallow and deep groundwater. Geostatistical modeling revealed consistent general patterns of As concentrations during the past 10 years, with high concentrations found along a NW–SE axis. By matching the geostatistical results with the distributions of As concentrations obtained through transport modeling, the deep-seated hydrothermal system along the fault zone was found to be the major As source. Wastewater from the mine was also observed to be a local As source. Another important influence on the As concentration pattern was a river, which acted as a boundary to separate the groundwater systems into two regions.},

abstract = {A combination of satellite-data processing and geostatistical spatial modeling is examined to investigate long-term changes in groundwater levels within a catchment basin and identify the causes of the changes. The data processing was used to obtain an accurate image classification of land covers while the geostatistical modeling was used to interpolate residual components of groundwater levels by removing identified trends from the original data. Our case study focused on the Kumamoto Plain, situated in central Kyushu, southwest Japan, where all of the water supply is derived from groundwater. A Linear Spectral Mixture was adopted to the 10 sub-scene images of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhancement Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors covering the study area for a 16-year period (1987-2003); this proved to be highly effective in detecting declining amounts of groundwater-recharging material. Descriptive statistical parameters from the groundwater-level data were integrated with the process of identifying, characterizing, and removing the trend components that are closely correlated with rainfall. Variogram modeling and ordinary kriging were used to construct a spatial model of the residual groundwater-level data. Finally, a multivariate model is proposed to estimate the degree of reduction in groundwater levels. The correlation coefficients between the observed and estimated residual levels by the multivariate regression model at 14 wells for the cross-validation range from 0.95 to 0.98. This demonstrates the applicability of the model to both the local areas around well sites and across the entire study area. To deepen the regression result, the Tukey honestly significantly different statistical test was applied. The test clarified that changes in land cover from rice field to urban areas have the greatest impact on reductions in groundwater within the recharge area. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in hydrothermal systems in China with emphasis on current studies of potential and reservoir engineering. Three hydrothermal systems, namely, Yangbajing, Xianyang, and Xiongxian, are used as case studies to represent high temperature granite reservoirs, medium-to-low temperature sandstone reservoirs, and medium-to-low temperature carbonate reservoirs, respectively. There is a huge potential of hydrothermal resources in China that have not been fully studied for possible exploitation. The study reveals that the potential of developing hydrothermal resources is preferable to exploitation of hot-dry-rock (HDR) systems in the near future. In order to enhance the utilization efficiency and prolong the economic lifetime of a geothermal field, reinjection needs to be increased, including treated wastewater as an option. In this regard, deep karstic aquifers containing hot water are the most ideal targets for development due to their favorable characteristics including high single-well yield, low salinity, easy reinjection, and fewer environmental impacts when exploited. The next challenge lies in the geothermal reservoir management for sustainable production. Numerical models describing the full complexity of coupled physicochemical thermodynamic processes such as the open source OpenGeoSys modeling platform are powerful tools for production planning as well as for assessing the possible environmental impacts. Comprehensive reservoir simulation should be employed to provide an optimal fluid production scheme and to maximize the sustainability in the development of a hydrothermal field.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to characterize in detail the temporal changes in Rn (radon-222) concentration in soil gases near fumaroles and clarify its correlation with volcanic earthquakes and temperatures in two geothermal reservoirs. Mt. Aso crater in southwest Japan, which has two reservoirs on its western side estimated by magnetotelluric survey to be at about 2km in depth, was selected for this study. For the long-term survey, the $\alpha$ scintillation counter method was used weekly for 12.5years at the three hot springs within a 2-km range. Rn concentrations were calculated using the CRAS method, a calculation method that considers radioactive equilibrium or nonequilibrium state of the soil gas. Rn concentrations generally showed similar fluctuation patterns among the sites. CRAS was used as a new indicator for evaluating the age of the soil gas. This age corresponds to the elapsed time determined from the generation of Rn based on the measurement of the numbers of atoms of Rn and its daughter 218Po at the start of measurement. In comparing the Rn data with the history of earthquakes in the Aso caldera, volcanic seismicity was identified as a major controlling factor in the sudden increase and decrease in Rn concentration as a function of age. For more precise detections of change, Rn concentrations were measured continuously at one site by pumping soil gas from a borehole and using an ionization chamber over 2.5years. Five chemical components (He, H2, N2, CH4, and CO2) were then measured by gas chromatography at 1-week intervals. Because Rn concentrations are affected strongly by atmospheric temperatures, the residual components were obtained by subtracting the trend of the components from the original data. Chemical component data were used to estimate the temperature and pressure in the reservoir at the site; temperatures ranged from 229 to 280°C, (average 265°C, average pressure 80MPa). Residual Rn concentrations showed a clear correlation with temporal changes in estimated temperature and, to a degree, with pressure. Considering the migration mechanism of Rn by molecular diffusion and advection under rapid gas upflow conditions, change in the diffusion coefficient is regarded as a possible factor to have induced temporal changes in Rn concentrations in conjunction with the temperature changes in the reservoirs. In addition, the increase of the amount of degassed Rn from the advective-convective hydrothermal fluids, which is associated with wall-rock fracturing, is another important factor. Earthquakes likely enhance the permeability of a reservoir by generating fractures, which in turn can cause an increase in the reservoir temperature, upflow fluid velocity, and gas flux. This provides one possible interpretation for the significant correlation of Rn concentrations with earthquakes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents a summary of a laboratory and field research program designed to evaluate the application of remote sensing techniques to geothermal exploration and development. The primary objective was to establish the feasibility of performing initial reconnaissance of an unmapped area with airborne or spacecraft remote sensors. The field experiments were conducted against a series of known geothermal regions in California. These regions were chosen to represent a typical range of geologic and environmental settings. It was attempted to relate remotely sensed and in-situ geophysical measurements of representative geothermal regions through a diurnal and seasonal range of variation. Effects of varying flight altitude on thermal anomaly « signatures \aa are also presented. Multiband photography in the visible and near infra-red was used to delineate anomalous spectral reflectance associated with hydrothermal alteration zones, passive \{\{IR\}\} imagery and radiometry in the 8 to 14 $\mu$ band, as well as passive microwave radiometry at 16 and 19 \{\{GHz\}\} was used to detect combined temperature and emissivity anomalies. Preliminary laboratory studies of field samples served to define the sensor passbands to be employed and permit later interpretation of observed effects. Ground controls on the experiment included detailed thermometric, gravity, magnetic and subsurface heat flow mapping. The major results of this investigation may be summarized as the identification of temperature anomalies in not only the infrared; but also the microwave, Rayleigh-Jeans region of the spectrum. Subsidiary conclusions were the uniform presence of visible alteration haloes, soil moisture anomalies, and apparent structural control of the thermal zones. While these techniques were applied in the nature of a controlled experiment, the results are considered generally applicable to related problems of geologic reconnaissance.},

This report presents several methods that are grouped into two categories depending on the natures of geologic data: type I for the data originated from plural populations and type II for the data that can be applied to the prerequisite of stationarity and have distinct spatial correlations. For the type I data, a spline-based method, its combination with stochastic simulation, and neural network method are demonstrated as effective, while geostatistics is certainly powerful tool for the type II data. As new approaches of geostatistics, an application to directional data such as fracture, multi-scale modeling that incorporates a scaling law, and space-time joint analysis for multivariate are reviewed briefly with case studies. These methods can contribute to Earth science and technology including rock engineering related to the problems such as repository of high-level nuclear waste and CCS (carbon dioxide capture and storage) which need the most comprehensive understandings of rock structures and properties.},

We compiled numerous indicators of these resources into a geographic information system along with concurrent investigative results. This effort required acquisition and analysis of spaceborne multispectral and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for early-stage geothermal exploration. We identified minerals such as alunite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite through analysis of hyperspectral data indicating regions of hydrothermally altered rock associated with areas of geothermal potential. Tertiary volcanic and granitic rocks also contain these indicator minerals. Quaternary environments displayed gypsum-bearing evaporite crusts that we postulate were deposited by sulfate-rich thermal waters. Throughout the PLPTL, tufa towers and tufa shoreline deposits are extensively distributed as remnants of paleo-lake Lahontan. Based on measured spectra of calcium carbonate, we mapped tufa towers elucidating the strike direction of associated faults. Additionally, we correlated remotely-derived maps of shoreline tufa deposits with climate-related changes in lake level. Our mapping results helped guide detailed exploration efforts to areas with the most geothermal potential. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Precise spatial estimation of ore grades and impurity contents from sample data limited in amount and location is indispensable to metallic and nonmetallic resource exploration. One of the advantages of using geostatistics for this purpose is that it can incorporate multivariate data into spatial estimation of one variable. However, there are two weak points concerning technical and post-processing problems. First is the difficulty in application to geologic data in which spatial correlations are not clear because of intrinsic nonlinear behavior. Second is the absence of indices to interpret the mechanisms and factors which govern the spatial distribution. To address these problems, a spatial method of modeling based on a feedforward neural network, SLANS, which recognizes the relationship between the data value and location by considering supplementary attributes such as lithology and biostratigraphy, and a sensitivity analysis using this network were developed. These methods were applied to two case studies, genetic mechanisms of kuroko deposits and quality assessment of a limestone mine. The first case study is a spatial analysis of principal metals of kuroko deposits (volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits) in the Hokuroku district, northern Japan. It was clarified that upward and downward sensitivity vectors were distinguished near the deposits inside and outside the tectonic basin, respectively. Sensitivity analysis for the second case study showed a strong effect of crystalline limestone on the important impurity, P2O5 contents. Hydrothermal alteration, which could cause leaching and secondary concentration of phosphorus, is considered to have produced this effect.},

Geothermal systems at depth may be identified at the surface by hot springs and fumaroles or by minerals produced by thermal fluids (hydrothermal alteration and hot spring deposits). Northern Fish Lake Valley, Nevada hosts two previously known geothermal fields. This study expanded prospects and identified new areas for future exploration within the valley. We demonstrated the potential for using remote sensing data to evaluate regions that are not well explored. We used visible, near, and shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5. ??m) remote sensing data to map surficial mineralogy. Data were collected by three airborne imaging spectrometer instruments, AVIRIS, HyMap, and ProSpecTIR, each over different parts of Fish Lake Valley. Minerals were identified using diagnostic spectral features. We verified remote sensing results in the field using a portable spectrometer to confirm agreement between field and remote spectra.The discovery of additional geothermal resources in Fish Lake Valley may provide the necessary added incentive to build costly transmission lines to this remote location. We used remote sensing data to delineate four new targets for future geothermal exploration in northern Fish Lake Valley. Two new areas of sinter and travertine deposits were identified northwest of the playa, likely deposited around fault-controlled hot springs during the Pleistocene when the water table was higher. Previously undocumented Miocene crystalline travertine was identified within the Emigrant Hills. Argillic alteration was mapped within ranges, where thermal fluids were likely discharged from faults to alter rhyolite tuff. Here we explain our data processing techniques which include a novel decorrelation stretch designed for geothermal prospecting, and discuss how remote sensing results guided our interpretation of the region's geothermal systems. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

In the frame of BIOSPEC (Linking spectral information at different spatial scales with biophysical parameters of Mediterranean vegetation in the context of global change) and FLUXPEC (Monitoring changes in water and carbon fluxes from remote and proximal sensing in Mediterranean “dehesa” ecosystem) projects LST retrieved from Landsat data is required to integrate ground-based observations of energy, water, and carbon fluxes with multi-scale remotely-sensed data and assess water and carbon balance in ecologically fragile heterogeneous ecosystem of Mediterranean wooded grassland (dehesa). Thus, three methods based on the Radiative Transfer Equation were used to extract LST from a series of 2009–2011 Landsat-5 TM images to assess the applicability for temperature input generation to a Landsat-MODIS LST integration. When compared to surface temperatures simulated using MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) with atmospheric profiles inputs (LSTref), values from Single-Channel (SC) algorithm are the closest (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.50 °C); procedure based on the online Radiative Transfer Equation Atmospheric Correction Parameters Calculator (RTE-ACPC) shows RMSD = 0.85 °C; Mono-Window algorithm (MW) presents the highest RMSD (2.34 °C) with systematical LST underestimation (bias = 1.81 °C). Differences between Landsat-retrieved LST and MODIS LST are in the range of 2 to 4 °C and can be explained mainly by differences in observation geometry, emissivity, and time mismatch between Landsat and MODIS overpasses. There is a seasonal bias in Landsat-MODIS LST differences due to greater variations in surface emissivity and thermal contrasts between landcover components.},

@article{Muffler1978Geothermics,
abstract = {A consistent, agreed-upon terminology is prerequisite for geothermal resource assessment. Accordingly, we propose a logical, sequential subdivision of the “geothermal resource base”, accepting its definition as all the thermal energy in the earth's crust under a given area, measured from mean annual temperature. That part of the resource base which is shallow enough to be tapped by production drilling is termed the “accessible resource base”, and it in turn is divided into “useful” and “residual” components. The useful component (i.e. the thermal energy that could reasonably be extracted at costs competitive with other forms of energy at some specified future time) is termed the “geothermal resource”. This in turn is divided into “economic” and “subeconomic” components, based on conditions existing at the time of assessment. In the format of a McKelvey diagram, this logic defines the vertical axis (degree of economic feasibility). The horizontal axis (degree of geologic assurance) contains “identified” and “undiscovered” components. “Reserve” is then designated as the identified economic resource. All categories should be expressed in units of thermal energy, with resource and reserve figures calculated at wellhead, prior to the inevitable large losses inherent in any practical thermal use or in conversion to electricity. Methods for assessing geothermal resources can be grouped into 4 classes: (a) surface thermal flux, (b) volume, (c) planar fracture and (d) magmatic heat budget. The volume method appears to be most useful because (1) it is applicable to virtually any geologic environment, (2) the required parameters can in Sprinciple be measured or estimated, (3) the inevitable errors are in part compensated and (4) the major uncertainties (recoverability and resupply) are amenable to resolution in the foreseeable future. The major weakness in all the methods rests in the estimation of how much of the accessible resource base can be extracted at some time in the future. In a manner similar to mineral and fuel assessment, this recoverability is expressed as a “recovery factor”. For an ideally permeable hot-water system, the recovery factor may be as much as 50\% and seems to be independent of temperature. It must decrease as effective porosity ($\phi$e) decreases, but the relation between the two is little more than a guess. On the other hand, for favorable systems like Larderello that produce steam by a mechanism of intergranular vaporization, the recovery factor is probably around 15–20\%, decreasing to zero at an effective porosity of zero. According to the anlysis of Bodvarsson (1974), it increases with decreasing reservoir temperature, and as pointed out by Nathenson (1975a) is limited at low temperatures by the need to have sufficient reservoir pressure for extraction and use. The extent to which a geothermal reservoir can be resupplied with heat during “industrial” times of 10–100 yr can be evaluated using simple analytical models. The results, combined with gravity and levelling data of Hunt (1977) for Wairakei and Isherwood (1977) for The Geysers, confirm earlier conclusions by Ramey (1970) and Nathenson (1975a) that resupply to reservoirs producing only steam can be neglected, and the conclusion of Nathenson (1975a) that it may be significant for hot-water systems of high natural discharge. Major subjects that demand continuing investigation include: 1.1. Determination of recovery factors as functions of temperature and effective porosity, particularly for hot-water systems.2.2. Evaluation of fluid recharge and heat resupply by repetitive gravity, levelling and underground temperature surveys in producing geothermal fields.3.3. Analysis of the extent to which a recovery factor can be enhanced by stimulation and by use of confined circulation loops.},

abstract = {Mt. Merapi, Indonesia, is one of the most active and dangerous volcanoes in the Torrid Zone. This volcano has erupted frequently and has produced pyroclastic flows following the collapse of the summit lava dome. We used Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by JERS-1 and RADARSAT-1 satellites from April 1996 to July 2006 to clarify the distribution patterns of the pyroclastic flow deposits. The extent of the deposits, termed P-zones, was accurately extracted by ratio operation and low-level feature extraction from SAR intensity images. These images highlighted temporal changes of the distribution area, perimeter, flow distance, included angle, and collapse direction. To validate the image-processing results, reflectance spectra of the rock samples collected after the eruption in June 2006 were measured in a laboratory. The reflectance spectra of all samples showed similar characteristics to the reference spectra, which were derived from atmospheric correction of Hyperion sensor image data covering the lava dome at the summit. Therefore, P-zones were confirmed to be the pyroclastic flow deposits originating from destruction of the lava dome at the summit. The image-processing results clarified that the extent of the distribution areas, perimeter, flow distances, and included angle of the P-zones were variable among the eruptions, while the collapse direction had a constant pattern. The collapse pattern followed a clockwise change from the south toward the west. By comparing the ratio maps of Bouguer gravity anomaly data in two periods, the change was interpreted to originate from the inclination of the conduit and the formation of shallow and deep magma reservoirs.},

abstract = {The Landsat-8 satellite of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in April 2013. Just weeks after it entered active service, its sensors observed activity at Paluweh Volcano, Indonesia. Given that the image acquired was in the daytime, its shortwave infrared observations were contaminated with reflected solar radiation; however, those of the satellite’s Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) show thermal emission from the volcano’s summit and flanks. These emissions detected in sensor’s band 10 (10.60–11.19 µm) have here been quantified in terms of radiant power, to confirm reports of the actual volcanic processes operating at the time of image acquisition, and to form an initial assessment of the TIRS in its volcanic observation capabilities. Data from band 11 have been neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable at the time of writing. At the instant of image acquisition, the thermal emission of the volcano was found to be 345 MW. This value is shown to be on the same order of magnitude as similarly timed NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer thermal observations. Given its unique characteristics, the TIRS shows much potential for providing useful, detailed and accurate volcanic observations in the future.},

abstract = {Landsat 8, a NASA and USGS collaboration, acquires global moderate-resolution measurements of the Earth's terrestrial and polar regions in the visible, near-infrared, short wave, and thermal infrared. Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40. year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements. ?? 2014.},

The CRAS utilizes the decay law between 222Rn and 220Rn isotopes and the daughter products 218Po and 216Po, and is applicable to a-scintillation counter measurements.The results for the new method as applied to the two case studies are consistent with the data collected from the geological survey. It implies that the CRAS method is suitable for investigating the fault system and interstitial gas mobility through fractures. The present analyses have also demonstrated that high Rn concentrations require the recent and repeated accumulation of 222Rn parents (230Th and 226Ra) in fault gouges through deep gas release during fault movement},

However, advances in the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors now available to ecologists are making the direct remote sensing of certain aspects of biodiversity increasingly feasible; for example, distinguishing species assemblages or even identifying species of individual trees. In cases where direct detection of individual organisms or assemblages is still beyond our grasp, indirect approaches offer valuable information about diversity patterns. Such approaches derive meaningful environmental parameters from biophysical characteristics that are revealed by remote sensing.},

abstract = {The Hokuroku district, extending over 40 × 40 km2 in northern Japan, is known to be dominated by kuroko-type massive sulfide deposits that have a genetic relation to submarine volcanic activity. The deposits are hosted in a specific stratigraphic zone of Miocene volcanic rocks. Because kuroko-type deposits are under exploration in several countries, it is important to integrate the geologic and geochemical data that have been accumulated in the Hokuroku district to characterize the distribution of deposits and produce a map of mineral potential. Thus, we collected data on multiple chemical components from 1917 rock cores at 143 drillhole sites and concentrated on components with relatively large amounts of data, which are SiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3 as major elements and Cu, Pb, and Zn as trace elements. Although frequencies of these data can be approximated by normal or lognormal distributions, spatial correlation structures cannot be extracted from the semivariograms of each component nor from the cross-semivariograms between two components of the major or minor elements. To handle such complexity, a spatial method of modeling content distribution, SLANS, is developed by applying a feedforward neural network. The principle of SLANS is to train a network repeatedly to recognize the relation between the data value and the location and lithology of a sample point. One-hundred outputs for each element are obtained by changing the numbers of neurons in a middle layer from 1 to 10 and sample data used for training from 3 to 12, and finally one output is selected based on the estimation precision of the network which is restricted near the target point. After constructing a geologic distribution model from the geological column classified into 25 rock codes, three-dimensional distributions of Cu, Pb, and Zn contents are estimated over the study area. The content models are considered to be valid because high-content zones are located on the known mine sites and the margins of ancient volcanoes or calderas. Some zones are distributed along strikes of major deep-seated fractures in the district.},

The evaluation methods have traditionally used 1-D models, but progress in computing power has recently allowed us to achieve joint interpretations, including the large-scale effects of geological, topographical and hydrogeological features. This paper describes the steps taken in a recent integrated assessment and evaluation of the geothermal potential of the most populated areas of Switzerland. The methodology accounts for individual utilization scenarios and is based on temperature data that have been systematically collected over many years. The state-of-the-art compilation involves comprehensive 3-D regional geological and thermal models of 20-40 km extent. Zones of significant convective flow or preferential sites for borehole heat exchanger systems (BHE) can then be identified. In contrast to the results obtained from earlier geothermal resource assessments, the existing geological, hydrogeological and petrophysical data are included in the full 3-D numerical evaluation. The first results, referred to a well-documented subsurface area in Northern Switzerland, are now available. Analysis of temperature data have confirmed the importance of these factors. © 2003 CNR.

abstract = {Accurate inversion of land surface geo/biophysical variables from remote sensing data for earth observation applications is an essential and challenging topic for the global change research. Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of earth surface processes from local to global scales. The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from the space. Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) is the newest thermal infrared sensor for the Landsat project, providing two adjacent thermal bands, which has a great benefit for the LST inversion. In this paper, we compared three different approaches for LST inversion from TIRS, including the radiative transfer equation-based method, the split-window algorithm and the single channel method. Four selected energy balance monitoring sites from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) were used for validation, combining with the MODIS 8 day emissivity product. For the investigated sites and scenes, results show that the LST inverted from the radiative transfer equation-based method using band 10 has the highest accuracy with RMSE lower than 1 K, while the SW algorithm has moderate accuracy and the SC method has the lowest accuracy.},

Various alternatives for estimating these SWA inputs are reviewed, and a sensitivity analysis of the SWA to misestimating the input parameters is performed. The accuracy of the current development was assessed using simulated Modtran data. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the simulated LST was calculated as 0.93 °C.

abstract = {Data from approximately 10,500 wells and more than 700 ground level data sets were used to develop a three-dimensional (3D) estimate of the subsurface temperature distribution in Germany. The temperature model was realized with universal kriging, and extends from ground level to 5000. m below sea level. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) mapping algorithms are often used to estimate subsurface temperature at certain depths. The major limitation of any 2D mapping is the possibility of inconsistencies between different depths due to the loss of information from shallower levels. A different approach is used in this paper. The application of 3D-kriging in the context of subsurface temperature estimation is described in detail and variation of data density and quality are also discussed. Kriging employs customized prediction parameters for an unbiased estimate of the subsurface temperature distribution. The kriging variance predicts the uncertainty of the temperature estimate and provides a local probability interval of the temperature estimate. The developed temperature model is part of the Geothermal Information System for Germany (GeotIS). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {After many years of stagnant growth in geothermal power generation, development plans for new geothermal plants have recently emerged throughout Japan. Through a literature review, we investigated the relationships between the principal barriers to geothermal development and we thereby analyzed the deciding factors in the future success of such enterprises. The results show that the societal acceptance of geothermal power by local stakeholders is the fundamental barrier as it affects almost all other barriers, such as financial, technical, and political risks. Thus, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 stakeholders including developers, hot spring inn managers, and local government officials. Some hot spring inn managers and local government officials noted that they have always been strongly concerned about the adverse effects of geothermal power generation on hot springs; their opposition has delayed decision-making by local governments regarding drilling permits, prolonged lead times, and caused other difficulties. A key reason for opposition was identified as uncertainty about the reversibility and predictability of the adverse effects on hot springs and other underground structures by geothermal power production and reinjection of hot water from reservoirs. Therefore, we discuss and recommend options for improving the risk management of hot springs near geothermal power plants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy for electricity generation has been produced commercially since 1913, and for four decades on the scale of hundreds of MW both for electricity generation and direct use. The utilization has increased rapidly during the last three decades. In 2000, geothermal resources have been identified in over 80 countries and there are quantified records of geothermal utilization in 58 countries in the world. The worldwide use of geothermal energy amounts to 49 TWh/a of electricity and 53 TWh/a for direct use. Electricity is produced with geothermal steam in 21 countries spread over all continents. Five countries obtain 10-22\% of their electricity from geothermal energy. Only a small fraction of the geothermal potential has been developed so far, and there is ample space for an accelerated use of geothermal energy both for electricity generation and direct applications. A comparison of the renewable energy sources (data from the UN World Energy Assessment Report) shows the current electrical energy cost to be 2-10 US??/kWh for geothermal and hydro, 5-13 US??/kWh for wind, 5-15 US??/kWh for biomass, 25-125 US??/kWh for solar photovoltaic and 12-18 US??/kWh for solar thermal electricity. Of the total electricity production from renewables of 2826 TWh in 1998, 92\% came from hydropower, 5.5\% from biomass, 1.6\% from geothermal and 0.6\% from wind. Solar electricity contributed 0.05\% and tidal 0.02\%. Comparing four "new" renewable energy sources (geothermal, wind, solar and tidal), shows 70\% of the electricity generated by the four to come from geothermal with only 42\% of the total installed capacity. Wind energy contributes 27\% of the electricity, but has 52\% of the installed capacity. Solar energy produces 2\% of the electricity and tidal energy 1\%. Biomass constitutes 93\% of the total direct heat production from renewables, geothermal 5\%, and solar heating 2\%. Heat production from renewables is commercially competitive with conventional energy sources. The current cost of direct heat from biomass is 1-5 US??/kWh, geothermal 0.5-5 US??/kWh, and solar heating 3-20 US??/kWh. Geothermal energy, with its proven technology and abundant resources, can make a significant contribution towards reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. ?? 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important variables measured by satellite remote sensing. Public domain data are available from the newly operational Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). This paper presents an adjustment of the split window algorithm (SWA) for TIRS that uses atmospheric transmittance and land surface emissivity (LSE) as inputs. Various alternatives for estimating these SWA inputs are reviewed, and a sensitivity analysis of the SWA to misestimating the input parameters is performed. The accuracy of the current development was assessed using simulated Modtran data. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the simulated LST was calculated as 0.93 °C. This SWA development is leading to progress in the determination of LST by Landsat-8 TIRS.},

abstract = {One application of lineaments interpreted from satellite images is to reveal dominant azimuth sets and distribution density of the derived lineaments for an extensive area. In this analysis, a lineament is treated literally as a straight line in the horizontal plane and any dip of the lineament is not considered. we propose a new method to calculate the azimuth (strike and dip angles) of 'fracture' planes through a combination of lineament maps and digital elevation models :(DEMs). A 'fracture' is created by connecting several lineaments, which appear to belong to the same system, using the criteria of distance and directional angle. The proposed method was applied to mines in an area of Cretaceous granite, an area of Miocene andesite and an area of Quaternary volcanic rocks in Japan. Lineaments in these areas were interpreted from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or SPOT panchromatic images using gthe segment tracing algorithm (STA). A correlation exists between interpreted 'fracture' orientations and (1) the predominant azimuth of joints appearing on the drift walls of a skarn deposit in the granite area and (2) the orientation of main gold veins in the andesite araea. Furthermore, interpreted 'fractures' are believed to act as conduits for transporting hydrothermal fluids to the surface in anhot spring area. Additionally, the proposed method is capable of calculating the intersection pattern of fractures at an arbitrary level below the ground surface.},

abstract = {Surface temperature anomalies associated with geothermal activity at Bradys Hot Springs, Churchill County, Nevada were mapped using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR) image data. In order to highlight subsurface contributions of geothermal heat, the ASTER images were processed to minimize temperature variations caused by the diurnal heating effects of the sun. Surface temperature variations caused by changes in albedo were corrected with visible and near-infrared ASTER bands, and a 10-meter-smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to correct for topographic slope effects. Field measurements of ground surface temperatures made over 24-hour periods were used to design a thermal inertia correction incorporating day and night thermal infrared images. In the resulting processed image, background temperature variations were reduced 30-50\% without reducing the intensity of geothermal anomalies, thus making it easier to distinguish geothermal activity from 'false' anomalies caused by non-thermal springs, topographic effects, and variable rock, soil, and vegetation compositions. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This study developed a geobotanical remote sensing method for detecting high water table zones using differences in the conditions of forest trees induced by groundwater supply in a humid warm-temperate region. A new vegetation index (VI) termed added green band NDVI (AgbNDVI) was proposed to discriminate the differences. The AgbNDVI proved to be more sensitive to water stress on green vegetation than existing VIs, such as SAVI and EVI2, and possessed a strong linear correlation with the vegetation fraction. To validate a proposed vegetation index method, a 23 km2 study area was selected in the Tono region of Gifu prefecture, central Japan. The AgbNDVI values were calculated from atmospheric corrected SPOT HRV data. To correctly extract high VI points, the influence factors on forest tree growth were identified using the AgbNDVI values, DEM and forest type data; the study area was then divided into 555 domains chosen from a combination of the influence factors and forest types. Thresholds for extracting high VI points were defined for each domain based on histograms of AgbNDVI values. By superimposing the high VI points on topographic and geologic maps, most high VI points are clearly located on either concave or convex slopes, and are found to be proximal to geologic boundaries-particularly the boundary between the Pliocene gravel layer and the Cretaceous granite, which should act as a groundwater flow path. In addition, field investigations support the correctness of the high VI points, because they are located around groundwater seeps and in high water table zones where the growth increments and biomass of trees are greater than at low VI points. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Alaska Energy Author- ity are jointly funding a project to re-assess the resource potential of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. Phase one of this project has included airborne thermal infrared remote sensing for mapping surface geothermal phenomena and assess- ment of the resource potential of the system. Thermal infrared and optical images were acquired over the Pilgrim Hot Springs site and neighboring regions during two surveys in fall 2010 and spring 2011. Thermal images providing information on land surface temperature at a spatial resolution better than 1.3 meters were acquired using a FLIR A320 camera operating in the broad 7.5−13 µm wavelength region. Fieldwork during the airborne surveys gathered ground calibration and validation data such as hot spring, ground, and at- mospheric temperatures, atmospheric humidity and the precise GPS locations of low-emissivity ground targets. We applied atmospheric correction, registration and mosaicking to generate seamless maps of calibrated surface temperature across the study area. Analysis of this data enables delineation of the main geothermal features of the system including hot springs, pools, and areas of thermally anomalous ground. Using a thermal-budget approach the thermal heat flux sustaining surface geothermal waters was estimated from the fall and spring FLIR data. Calculated heat fluxes and outflow rates assuming a hot spring temperature of 81°C is significantly higher than previous field-based methods. Our work demonstrates that airborne thermal infrared remote sensing provides a rapid and relatively low cost method for mapping and quantitative assessment of undeveloped spring-dominated geothermal systems in Alaska},

abstract = {Geologic data obtained by drilling investigations, field measurements, and laboratory tests are irregularly distributed with respect to location both horizontally and vertically. Spatial discontinuities impact soil classification, hydraulic conductivity, and chemical content. In this study, a three-dimensional modeling method, which combines the optimization principle method and a stochastic simulation method, was developed (OPTSIM). This method consists of three steps: the transformation of geologic attributes into binary (0 or 1) under certain thresholds, the three-dimensional interpolation of these transformed binary data, and the construction of conditional cumulative distribution functions (CCDF) by repeatedly changing the threshold and interpolation analysis. The Monte Carlo method was then used to inversely determine the attributes from the constructed CCDFs. Three types of attribute expressed by value, code, and class were examined. The OPTSIM was applied to spatial modeling of geotechnical structures in the Kumamoto plain, southwest Japan, using two kinds of data, lithologic units and physical soil properties. Resistivity data obtained by electric logging and the locations of screens were linked to geologic distribution. The constructed model contributed to the location of chief aquifers and estimates of amount of shallow groundwater. A combination of granular composition, N value, and water content was examined. Transgression and regression patterns following the last glacial stage were also inferred through this analysis. In both applications, discontinuities in lithologic units and soil properties resulting from fault movements and sea-level changes were successfully expressed in the distribution models. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Morphotectonic lineaments observed on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt were auto-detected from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 90-m digital elevation model (DEM) and gravity grid data and then analyzed to characterize the tectonic trends that dominated the geologic evolution of this area. The approach employed consists of DEM shading, segment tracing, grouping, statistical analysis of the distribution and orientation of the lineaments, fault plane characterization, and smooth representation techniques. Statistical quantification of counts, mean lengths, densities, and orientations was used to infer the relative severity of the tectonic regimes, to unravel the prominent structural trends, and to demarcate the contribution of various faulting styles that prevailed through time. Restored to the present-day geographic position, prominent N50°-60°W, N20°-40°W, N50°-60°E, and N20°-30°E and less prominent N-S, E-W, and ENE trends were common. The prominence of these trends varied through time. The NW and NE trends showed relatively equal abundances in the Precambrian and the Cambrian whereas the prominence of the NW trends prevailed from the Carboniferous to the Holocene. Lineaments in all formations were near vertical and on average, about 65\% showed as strike-slip, 22\% as reverse, and 13\% as normal faulting styles. Statistics from the detected linear features and the reference geological data reveal the relative severity of five dominant tectonic regimes: Precambrian compression followed by extension at its end, Cretaceous compression, Eocene compression, Miocene extension, and finally Holocene compression. Auto-detected lineaments and the severity of the characterized tectonic periods correspond well with reference data on the geologic structure, geodynamic framework, and the gravity anomaly. Furthermore, the recent significance of the broad structural zones was confirmed by the foci of the earthquake epicenters along and at the intra-plate intersections of the broad lineament zones and at the plate boundaries. The spatial distribution of trends with varying styles of faulting distinguished four main tectonic provinces of marked geodynamics variances. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An understanding of the geomorphology and distribution of surface materials on an active volcano is crucial to characterize eruptions and mitigate volcanic hazards. For volcanoes, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing is the only useful observation and monitoring technology that can be undertaken in any weather condition. This letter uses the data from one type of airborne SAR system termed polarimetric and interferometric airborne SAR and L-band microwaves to classify SAR imagery into geomorphologic units, based on a scattering mechanism, using the example of Mt. Sakurajima, a representative active volcano situated in southern Japan. This is accomplished by adopting a Bayesian decision classification (BDC) scheme applied to two polarimetric parameters, namely, entropy and the type of scattering mechanism, which are derived from Cloude-Pottier decomposition of full polarimetry. In spite of the thick vegetation cover, BDC can divide SAR imagery from Mt. Sakurajima into three geomorphologic units: volcanic cone, terrace, and foot. The suitability of the BDC classification of microwave sensor imagery-and its superiority over a traditional classification scheme, the K -means unsupervised classification-is confirmed by polarimetric signature analysis and ground-truth surveying that directly quantifies surface scattering.},

abstract = {A set of techniques was developed for automatically detecting tectonic lineaments from multi-source remotely-sensed data at various scales. The techniques include adaptive shading of grid data to enhance linear features, a segment-tracing algorithm to extract line segments from the shaded grid data, grouping of the segments by concatenating short segments, and connecting them by proximity and co-linearity criteria to form a lineament that represents significant tectonic structure. B-spline smoothing was adopted for lineament representation. Finally, a technique for assessing the orientations and styles of faulting (normal, reverse, and strike-slip types) was developed for use in characterizing the extrapolated fracture planes. The applicability of the developed techniques was examined using 30. arc-second topography/bathymetry grids, 1-min gravity anomaly grids, and 2-min total field magnetic intensity grids covering Egypt and its surroundings. Lineaments derived from data types so diverse in composition and from various depths corresponded well with the referenced tectonic features over much of the region. Prominent trends and faulting styles of lineaments provided important clues as to the timing of their development as well as strong support for a structural inheritance model. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed techniques combined with integration of remotely-sensed data in detecting regional fracture systems accurately and in characterizing geodynamics over a long timeframe. © 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Frequent$\backslash$nmonitoring of spatio-temporal changes of TSS distribution in such areas$\backslash$nis indispensable for understanding sediment fluxes and water cycles, and$\backslash$nto preserve ecosystem health. This study aimed to identify appropriate$\backslash$nand sufficient tools for assessing changes in TSS distribution in Tien$\backslash$nYen Bay in Northern Vietnam, a typical closed bay, which was selected as$\backslash$nthe study area because of its rich biodiversity. Initially, a physical$\backslash$nbased model using the reflectance at the sea surface was developed for$\backslash$nestimating TSS concentrations from satellite image data, and a model$\backslash$nwith an exponential function was identified as suitable for the$\backslash$nestimation. This model was fitted appropriately to provide a$\backslash$nrelationship between reflectance from the MODIS/Terra band 1 (visible$\backslash$nred) after the atmospheric correction and the in situ TSS concentrations$\backslash$nat 40 points. Ordinary kriging was then shown to be effective in$\backslash$nimproving the spatial resolution of the MODIS/Terra image-based$\backslash$nestimation of the TSS concentration at a 250 m interval, because it$\backslash$ncould detect TSS variation in detail, in particular in the local$\backslash$nestuaries. TSS distributions derived from 12 MODIS/Terra images from$\backslash$nNovember 2009 to October 2010 clarified seasonal changes in TSS during$\backslash$none year. TSS concentrations were high during summer and lower during$\backslash$nfall and winter. Such trends were conformable with the hydrodynamics in$\backslash$nTien Yen Bay. Consequently, the proposed method was more effective for$\backslash$nTSS estimation than traditional methods using satellite image data only.},

New data have been taken from WGC2010 country update reports, private communications from IGA members and affiliated organizations. Other updates have been collected from websites of private and public organizations involved in geothermal development. Plants commissioned in 2010 (after WGC2010) have been included in the installed capacity, even though their produced energy has not been accounted for. An increase of about 2GW (herein we use MW and GW for the electrical capacity and MWth and GWth for thermal capacity) in the five year term 2005-2010 has been achieved (about 22\%), following the rough linear trend of approximately 400MW/year, with an evident increase of the average value of about 200MW/year in the 2000-2005 period (Bertani, 2005a,b, 2006, 2007). The most significant data to be highlighted from this paper are:???a total of 24 countries now generate electricity from geothermal resources;???the total installed capacity worldwide is 10,898MW, corresponding to about 67,246GWh of electricity (early 2010 data);???Germany, Papua - New Guinea, Australia, Turkey, Iceland, Portugal, New Zealand, Guatemala, Kenya, and Indonesia have increased the capacity of their power plant installations by more than 50\% with respect to the year 2005;???the top five countries for their electricity production are USA, Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico and Italy;???five countries realized an increase above 100MW with respect to 2005: USA, Indonesia, Iceland, New Zealand and Kenya.The prospective for growth during 2010-2015 are good, with a strong possibility of realizing a big increase in the installed capacity up to 19.

Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data are used within this study, the temporal resolution providing several overpasses throughout a single diurnal cycle at a suitable spatial and radiometric resolution. The technique of thermal inertia mapping by airborne and satellite-borne sensors has opened a new field of quantitative thermal property interpretation from thermal infrared remote sensing surveys. The algorithms adopted to calculate the ground heat flux were based on the second-order approximation thermal inertia model (SoA-TI model) of Xue and Cracknell. Not only the amplitude of the surface temperature wave but also the phase information of the surface temperature change are used. The approach is demonstrated by using some AVHRR data from France.},

abstract = {One of the factors that determines the suitability of limestone for industrial use and its commercial value is phosphorus (P) content, i.e., the weight percentage of phosphorus contained in small quantities of limestone. Because P content changes locally, geostatistical techniques including semivariogram, ordinary kriging, and conditional indicator sequential simulation were used in this study to identify the spatial correlation of P content and to estimate its three-dimensional distribution in an open-pit mine. The P content data at 43,000 points of five different bench levels were analyzed. It was found that the horizontal semivariograms produced by using the data at the same bench level show anisotropic behavior and are represented by the sum of two spherical models with different ranges and sills. The twelve vertical semivariograms were also constructed from P content in boring cores. After these semivariograms were classified into four types, a multilayered neural network was applied to clarify the horizontal distribution of each one. One of the twelve semivariograms was assigned to an arbitrary grid point in the study area by the criterion that its type is the same as the one estimated at the point and the borehole site producing the semivariogram is the nearest to the point. With this technique, ordinary kriging combined with the semivariogram of borehole data provided a proper estimation of P content in the depth direction.},

abstract = {Mud volcanoes are relatively small spatter cones that erupt water-laden mud and gases, and occur throughout the world. For many mud volcanoes, the eruption of warm mud (10-40°C) can be detected with high-resolution thermal satellite imagery. We demonstrate the utility of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery for thermal monitoring of active mud volcanism. We constrain the temperature and area of active mud discharge and estimate surface heat flux for two isolated mud volcanoes in the Copper River Basin, Alaska using Band 6 (10.4-12.5 $\mu$m). The heat flux results span a wide range due to uncertainties in the environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition, but can be constrained to be less than 0.24 MW for each of the two mud volcanoes considering previously published field measurements. With this higher-resolution Band 6 on the ETM+ sensor, as well as the high-resolution thermal bands on the ASTER sensor, reliable monitoring of mud volcanism on this scale is possible for the first time. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The geothermal potential of a deep sedimentary-rock reservoir, in a Tertiary graben, the Limagne d'Allier basin (Massif Central, France), is assessed. The most interesting geothermal target is identified as a thick basal Tertiary sandstone overlying crystalline Paleozoic basement. The total amount of recoverable energy in this clastic aquifer is estimated at over 500PJ (500×1015 J) in the modelled area. The most promising zones appear along the north-western edges of the basin, where sediment infill is thickest. The methodology used for estimating geothermal potential starts from geological field data. The first step is to obtain a better understanding of the structure and geometry of the target zone, using various data such as field measurements, and borehole and geophysical data. These data are reinterpreted through the construction of a 3D geological model. Inconsistencies are checked and turned into a coherent 3D interpretation. The second step consists in meshing the geological model into an unstructured 3D finite-element mesh where realistic thermal boundary conditions are applied. The temperature field is computed in a third step. The thermal calculation is achieved by assuming a purely conductive behaviour and through comparison with existing borehole profiles. The computed temperatures fit the measurements in the deepest part of the Limagne d'Allier basin, while the potential role of fluid flow is highlighted in its upper part, either within more permeable formations, or around the boreholes. A fourth, final, step maps the geothermal potential (recoverable energy) in the deepest part of the Tertiary graben, where the total amount of geothermal energy available is calculated. The result of this work provides valuable guidelines for geothermal exploration in the area and our methodology can be replicated elsewhere. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Land Surface Temperature (LST) is one of the key inputs for Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere transfer modeling in terrestrial ecosystems. In the frame of BIOSPEC (Linking spectral information at different spatial scales with biophysical parameters of Mediterranean vegetation in the context of global change) and FLUXPEC (Monitoring changes in water and carbon fluxes from remote and proximal sensing in Mediterranean “dehesa” ecosystem) projects LST retrieved from Landsat data is required to integrate ground-based observations of energy, water, and carbon fluxes with multi-scale remotely-sensed data and assess water and carbon balance in ecologically fragile heterogeneous ecosystem of Mediterranean wooded grassland (dehesa). Thus, three methods based on the Radiative Transfer Equation were used to extract LST from a series of 2009–2011 Landsat-5 TM images to assess the applicability for temperature input generation to a Landsat-MODIS LST integration. When compared to surface temperatures simulated using MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) with atmospheric profiles inputs (LSTref), values from Single-Channel (SC) algorithm are the closest (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.50 °C); procedure based on the online Radiative Transfer Equation Atmospheric Correction Parameters Calculator (RTE-ACPC) shows RMSD = 0.85 °C; Mono-Window algorithm (MW) presents the highest RMSD (2.34 °C) with systematical LST underestimation (bias = 1.81 °C). Differences between Landsat-retrieved LST and MODIS LST are in the range of 2 to 4 °C and can be explained mainly by differences in observation geometry, emissivity, and time mismatch between Landsat and MODIS overpasses. There is a seasonal bias in Landsat-MODIS LST differences due to greater variations in surface emissivity and thermal contrasts between landcover components.},

abstract = {Visible near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has long been used for geothermal exploration. Specific focus on the TIR region (8-12. $\mu$m) has resulted in major-rock-forming mineral classes being identified and their areal percentages to be more easily mapped due in part to the linear mixing behavior of TIR emission. To understand the mineral compositional and thermal distribution of active geothermal surfaces systems, hyperspectral TIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) airborne sensor were acquired over the Salton Sea, CA geothermal fields by The Aerospace Corporation on March 26, 2009 and April 6, 2010. SEBASS collects 128 wavelength channels at \~{}. 1. m spatial resolution. Such high resolution data are rarely available for this type of scientific analysis and enabled the identification of rare mineral assemblages associated with the geothermally-active areas. One surface unit with a unique spectrum, believed to be a magnesium sulfate of unknown hydration state, was identified for the first time in the SEBASS data. The abundance and distribution of this mineral varied between 2009 and 2010 likely due to the precipitation conditions. Data obtained by the SEBASS sensor were also regressed to the 32 channel spectral resolution of the Mineral and Gas Identifier (MAGI) airborne sensor in order to test sensitivity limits. At this lower spectral resolution, all surface minerals were still effectively identified and therefore validated data at MAGI resolution are still very effective for accurate surface compositional mapping. A similar approach used at active geothermal areas in other semi-arid regions around the world has the potential to better characterize transient mineralogy, identify "indicators minerals", understand the influence of surface and ground water, and ultimately to locate new geothermal targets for future exploration. Furthermore, new Mineral and Gas Identification (MAGI) data serve as an excellent precursor for future spaceborne TIR data such as the system proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) instrument. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Surface roughness is an important variable of geomorphologic research and hydrological modeling, and widely used in the Earth and planetary science. It plays an important role in determining how a ground object will interact with its environment. Quantification of surface-roughness variability using Digital elevation model (DEM) were applied to study area of Beichuan County, one of the most destructed areas during the Wenchuan earthquake (7.9 Mw at 14:28:01.42 CST on May 12, 2008). In this paper, four types of DEM were chosen for multi-scale assessment of the surface roughness. Three algorithms were employed, which were Root mean square of elevation, standard deviation of elevation, standard deviation of curvature profile. An overall trend of inclined to be flat from pre-earthquake to post-earthquake could be examined through the three measure methods, which indicate that Wenchuan earthquake indeed had effects on changing the surface roughness. The method of Root mean square of elevation shows the most obvious results in depicting the change before and after the earthquake. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Water containing high concentrations of nitrate is unfit for human consumption and, if discharging to freshwater or marine habitats, can contribute to algal blooms and eutrophication. The level of nitrate contamination in groundwater of two densely populated, agro-industrial areas of the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL) (Banana Plain and Mount Cameroon area) was evaluated. A total of 100 samples from boreholes, open wells and springs (67 from the Banana Plain; 33 from springs only, in the Mount Cameroon area) were collected in April 2009 and January 2010 and analyzed for chemical constituents, including nitrates. The average groundwater nitrate concentrations for the studied areas are: 17.28 mg/l for the Banana Plain and 2.90 mg/l for the Mount Cameroon area. Overall, groundwaters are relatively free from excessive nitrate contamination, with nitrate concentrations in only 6 \% of groundwater resources in the Banana Plain exceeding the maximum admissible concentration for drinking water (50 mg/l). Sources of NO3 − in groundwater of this region may be mainly anthropogenic (N-fertilizers, sewerage, animal waste, organic manure, pit latrines, etc.). Multivariate statistical analyses of the hydrochemical data revealed that three factors were responsible for the groundwater chemistry (especially, degree of nitrate contamination): (1) a geogenic factor; (2) nitrate contamination factor; (3) ionic enrichment factor. The impact of anthropogenic activities, especially groundwater nitrate contamination, is more accentuated in the Banana Plain than in the Mount Cameroon area. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of multivariate statistical analysis in groundwater study as a supplementary tool for interpretation of complex hydrochemical data sets.},

The first of them lies on the estimation of the land surface temperature from the radiative transfer equation using in situ radiosounding data. The others two are the mono-window algorithm developed by Qin et al.

The land surface emissivity (LSE) values needed in order to apply these methods have been estimated from a methodology that uses the visible and near infrared bands. Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jim\'{e}nez-Mu\~{n}oz algorithm is used. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A surface energy balance was conducted to calculate the latent heat flux ($\lambda$E) using aerodynamic methods and the Penman–Monteith (PM) method. Computations were based on gridded weather and Landsat satellite reflected and thermal data. The surface energy balance facilitated a comparison of impacts of different parameterizations and assumptions, while calculating $\lambda$E over large areas through the use of remote sensing. The first part of the study compares the full aerodynamic method for estimating latent heat flux against the appropriately parameterized PM method with calculation of bulk surface resistance (rs). The second part of the study compares the appropriately parameterized PM method against the PM method, with various relaxations on parameters. This study emphasizes the use of separate aerodynamic equations (latent heat flux and sensible heat flux) against the combined Penman–Monteith equation to calculate $\lambda$E when surface temperature (Ts) is much warmer than air temperature (Ta), as will occur under water stressed conditions. The study was conducted in southern Idaho for a 1000-km2 area over a range of land use classes and for two Landsat satellite overpass dates. The results show discrepancies in latent heat flux ($\lambda$E) values when the PM method is used with simplifications and relaxations, compared to the appropriately parameterized PM method and full aerodynamic method. Errors were particularly significant in areas of sparse vegetation where differences between Ts and Ta were high. The maximum RMSD between the correct PM method and simplified PM methods was about 56 W/m2 in sparsely vegetated sagebrush desert where the same surface resistance was applied.},

Field observations of these basins provided the critical ground-truth for comparison with the remote sensing results. Fourteen study sites were selected based on diversity in size, deposit type, and thermal activity. Field work included detailed site surveys such as land cover analysis, photography, Global Positioning System (GPS) data collection, radiometric analysis, and VNIR spectroscopy. Samples of hot spring deposits, geyser deposits, and soil were also collected. Analysis of ASTER data provided broad scale characteristics of the hot springs and their deposits, including the identification of thermal anomalies. AVIRIS high spectral resolution short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy provided the ability to detect hydrothermally altered minerals as well as a calibration for the multispectral SWIR ASTER data. From the image analysis, differences in these basins were identified including the extent of thermal alteration, the location and abundance of alteration minerals, and a comparison of active, near-extinct, and extinct geysers. We determined the activity level of each region using a combination of the VNIR-SWIR-TIR spectral differences as well as the presence of elevated temperatures, detected by the TIR subsystem of ASTER. The results of this study are applicable to the exploration of extinct mineralized hydrothermal deposits on both Earth and Mars. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Remote sensing provides a broad view of landscapes and can be consistent through time, making it an important tool for monitoring and managing protected areas. An impediment to broader use of remote sensing science for monitoring has been the need for resource managers to understand the specialized capabilities of an ever-expanding array of image sources and analysis techniques. Here, we provide guidelines that will enable land managers to more effectively collaborate with remote sensing scientists to develop and apply remote sensing science to achieve monitoring objectives. We first describe fundamental characteristics of remotely sensed data and change detection analysis that affect the types and range of phenomena that can be tracked. Using that background, we describe four general steps in natural resource remote sensing projects: image and reference data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, and evaluation. We emphasize the practical considerations that arise in each of these steps. We articulate a four-phase process that guides natural resource and remote sensing specialists through a collaborative process to articulate goals, evaluate data and options for image processing, refine or eliminate unrealistic paths, and assess the cost and utility of different options. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

New data have been taken from WGC2010 country update reports, private communications from IGA members and affiliated organizations. Other updates have been collected from websites of private and public organizations involved in geothermal development. Plants commissioned in 2010 (after WGC2010) have been included in the installed capacity, even though their produced energy has not been accounted for. An increase of about 2GW (herein we use MW and GW for the electrical capacity and MWth and GWth for thermal capacity) in the five year term 2005-2010 has been achieved (about 22\%), following the rough linear trend of approximately 400MW/year, with an evident increase of the average value of about 200MW/year in the 2000-2005 period (Bertani, 2005a,b, 2006, 2007). The most significant data to be highlighted from this paper are:???a total of 24 countries now generate electricity from geothermal resources;???the total installed capacity worldwide is 10,898MW, corresponding to about 67,246GWh of electricity (early 2010 data);???Germany, Papua - New Guinea, Australia, Turkey, Iceland, Portugal, New Zealand, Guatemala, Kenya, and Indonesia have increased the capacity of their power plant installations by more than 50\% with respect to the year 2005;???the top five countries for their electricity production are USA, Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico and Italy;???five countries realized an increase above 100MW with respect to 2005: USA, Indonesia, Iceland, New Zealand and Kenya.The prospective for growth during 2010-2015 are good, with a strong possibility of realizing a big increase in the installed capacity up to 19.

abstract = {Hyperspectral remote sensing-derived mineral maps and follow-up shallow temperature measurements were used to identify a new blind geothermal target in the Columbus Salt Marsh playa, Esmeralda County, Nevada. The hyperspectral survey was conducted with the ProSpecTIR VS2 instrument and consists of 380 km2 of 4-meter spatial resolution data acquired on October 29, 2008, covering the playa and surrounding hills. Using these data, borate and sulfate evaporite minerals and opal/chalcedony, carbonates and argillic alteration were identified and mapped. Field samples were collected and validated with laboratory spectral measurements and x-ray diffractometer analysis. Mineral maps were then used to guide a shallow temperature survey with nearly 100 two-meter-deep measurements. The largest area of sulfate and borate crusts identified with the hyperspectral survey occurs in the southwestern portion of the playa. Directly up the hydrologic gradient from these crusts, the 2-meter survey identified a 4.1 km by 1.7 km area of anomalous shallow temperatures. The shape of this temperature anomaly is elongate in an east-northeast direction parallel to, and along trend with, nearby Quaternary faults, and the down-slope direction of this trend points towards the area of sulfate and borate crusts. A cold spring associated with some of the sulfate and borate crusts yields anomalous geothermometer temperatures (115°C and 137°C, respectively for the quartz and Mg-corrected Na-K-Ca geothermometers), providing corroboration of a geothermal component to shallow groundwaters in the playa. A geothermal reservoir may exist at depth in the vicinity of, or laterally displaced from, the shallow temperature anomaly, in an area with a fanning strike pattern of Quaternary faults.},

abstract = {In addition to spatial distribution of groundwater-flow parameters, aquifer properties of location and shape are also significant for assessing groundwater resources because they strongly affect water flow. We present a selection of geologic data suitable for aquifer analysis, a mathematical method of processing them, and a combination of several maps produced by it. The data used in the analysis are typically obtained by borehole investigation. Our targets are the areas underlain by geologic bodies with different ages and lithologies; the spatial correlation structures of geologic data over the areas tend to change locally. The processing method should be a versatile one that is applicable to areas where geostatistical stationarity is not satisfied. The aquifer analysis consistent with that requirement consists of two steps: the first is the transformation of screen locations, locations of sand and gravel layers, and resistivity by electric logging into indicator values, and the second is three-dimensional interpolation of these using the optimization principle method to produce three kinds of distribution models. A stochastic simulation is also used for modeling the resistivity distribution. The three distribution models are integrated to generate a value for evaluating the possibility of aquifer existence. A case study of an alluvial coastal plain, situated in southwest Japan, describes an aquifer model that contains three permeable layers. Each layer has about 10-m thickness and is lens shaped. To confirm the validity of the model, we have drilled two wells that reached one of the middle and bottom permeable layers, observing the water level change. Low correlation of the temporal changes of levels between the wells indicates that the two layers are hydrologically independent of each other. Additionally, groundwater-flow patterns have been estimated by transforming the simulation model parameter into hydraulic conductivity through a simple function and using a finite difference method for flow analysis. The procedure proposed by this study can be applied to other areas by changing the weights assigned to each geologic and geotechnical factor in the generation of the coefficient for aquifer existence, considering the reliability of each factor and hydrologic properties of study area. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In Japan, many major cities are located on tectonic basins which are surrounded by faults and underlain by soft alluvial materials. Because these areas are subject to earthquake damages, it is important to determine their seismic engineering characteristics. Geotechnical databases which contain many borehole logs are useful information sources for this type of analysis. Each datum stored in the database has a value or an attribute, and its location is irregular in both horizontal and vertical directions. A new interpolation method based on the optimization principle is proposed here to deal with such three-dimensionally distributed data. Susceptibility of unconsolidated ground to liquefaction is known to be related to the content of loose and saturated sand. The mixture ratio of several soil types in a deposit, i.e., granular composition, is strongly influenced by the sedimentary environment. There are two numerical methods: the optimization principle method (OPM) used to determine three-dimensional distribution of granular composition and the model used to evaluate liquefaction. The application of the proposed methods to two locations in Japan indicated that the zones with high susceptibility to liquefaction were indeed those that had suffered from liquefaction during past earthquakes.},

abstract = {The accurate imaging of geothermal systems from the ground surface down to great depths is an interdisciplinary problem common to geothermal resource exploration and development. Rocks can be characterized mainly in terms of their lithology, mineralogy, fracture distribution, permeability, thermal conductivity and porosity, and similarly the geothermal fluid (and its circulation) by its geochemistry, flow pattern, velocity, temperature and pressure. Some of these data are obtained by well logging and from laboratory tests conducted on drillhole cores. In general, the distribution of geothermal wells is not random, and well data are limited in terms of quantity and depth range. Accordingly, a sophisticated spatial modeling technique is indispensable in the three-dimensional imaging of geothermal systems. We describe a versatile 3-D modeling method that can be used to determine the temperature, flow velocity, and distribution of geological units within a geothermal field based on well log data. The model results for the Hohi geothermal area, Japan, provide plausible estimates of temperature, flow velocity, and geology to a depth of 3000 m. Superimposition of the three spatial models we obtained shows that, at Hohi, two geothermal reservoirs are localized near highly fractured fault zones that provide paths for the ascent of thermal fluids from depth. © 2007 CNR.},

abstract = {This study presents a new geostatistical approach to characterization of the geometry and quality of a multilayer coal deposit using the data of seam thickness as a geometric property and the contents of ash, sodium, total sulphur, and the heating value as quality properties. A coal deposit in East Kalimantan (Borneo), Indonesia, which has a synclinal geological structure, was chosen as the study site. Semivariogram analysis clarified the strong dependence of heating value on ash content in the top and bottom parts of each seam and the existence of a strong correlation with sodium content over the sub-seams in the same location. The correlations between the geometry and quality of the seams were generally weak. A linear coregionalization model was used to derive the spatial correlation coefficients of two variables at each scale component from the single- and cross-semivariogram matrices. Because the data were correlated spatially in the same seam or over different seams, multivariate techniques (ordinary cokriging and factorial cokriging) were mainly used and the resultant spatial estimates were compared to those derived using a univariate technique (ordinary kriging). A factorial cokriging was effective to decompose the spatial correlation structures with different scales. Another important characteristic was that the sodium content shows distinct segregation: the low zones are concentrated near the boundary of the sedimentary basin, while the high zones are concentrated in the central part. The main component of sodium originates from the abundance of saline water. Therefore, it can be inferred that seawater had stronger effects on the coal depositional process in the central basin than in the border part. The geostatistical modeling results suggest that the thicknesses of all the major seams were controlled by the syncline structure, while the coal qualities chiefly were originated from the coal depositional and diagenetic processes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Wenchuan (汶川) earthquake triggered cascading disasters of landslides and debris flows that caused severe vegetation damage. Fracture zones can affect geodynamics and spatial pattern of vegetation damage. A segment tracing algorithm method was applied for identifying the regional fracture system through lineament extractions from a shaded digital elevation model with 25 m mesh for southern Wenchuan. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were used to analyze the spatiotemporal vegetation pattern. The relationship between vegetation type identified from satellite images and lineament density was used to characterize the distribution patterns of each vegetation type according to fracture zones. Broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, and farmland persist in areas with moderate lineament density. Deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forest persists in less fractured areas. Shrub and meadow seem to be relatively evenly distributed across all lineament densities. Meadow, farmland, and shrub persist in the fractured areas. Changes of spatial structure and correlation between vegetation patterns before and after the earthquake were examined using semivariogram analysis of normalized difference vegetation indices derived from Landsat enhanced thematic mapper images. The sill values of the semivariograms show that the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation covers increased after the earthquake. Moreover, the anisotropic behaviors of the semivariograms coincide with the vegetation changes due to the strikes of fracture zones.},

abstract = {Widespread definition of a groundwater system in three dimensions is necessary for the management and maintenance of groundwater resources. A magnetotelluric (MT) survey can be an effective geophysical prospecting method for imaging regional geological structures by measuring both shallow and deep resistivity. To demonstrate the capability of an MT survey to characterize a groundwater system, the Kumamoto area of central Kyushu in southwestern Japan was selected as a case study site because of its rich groundwater resources. Three-dimensional (3D) MT resistivity structure to a depth of 5 km was modeled by 1D inversion analysis of raw MT data and 3D interpolation of the resultant resistivity column data by the optimization principle method. Consequently, both deep and shallow aquifers were detected. A high-resistivity zone appears at depths between 500 and 2,000 m between the Futagawa–Hinagu faults and the Usuki–Yatsushiro tectonic line, which supports the existence of an aquiclude under the aquifer. The most important characteristic inferred from the 3D resistivity model is that the deep groundwater system below a depth of 1,000 m has two main flow paths. One path is likely to be through porous rocks because the low resistivity zone is regarded as tuff with sand and gravel, and the other flow path is interpreted to be through fractured zones along the Hinagu faults. Hence, the path and direction of the groundwater flows are probably controlled by geologic structures and the configuration of the active faults. These findings support the effectiveness of the MT method for investigating groundwater systems.},

abstract = {Coal reserve estimation requires comprehensive spatial analysis of geologic and geochemical data. For determination of coal reserve uncertainty associated with tonnage and grade (quality), we present a new approach that stands on spatial modeling of seam distribution and coal quality. A multilayer coal deposit in East Kalimantan, Indonesia was selected as a case study site. Coal quality was evaluated by ash and sodium contents, total sulphur, and heating value. Their spatial models were produced by geostatistical methods, ordinary kriging and sequential Gaussian simulation, which were effective to evaluate local or global uncertainty by honoring spatial correlation structures. The seam distribution was modeled by a binary transformation of the geologic data and the three-dimensional optimization method. It is demonstrated that the lower seam sequence has the highest degree of uncertainty because of low average coal accumulation (tonnage) and the sparseness of sample data points in the north part of the study area. This study demonstrates that uncertainty of coal accumulation is related to the seam distribution and that spatial variability patterns of coal qualities are opposing between ash content and total sulphur: this difference might have been caused by geological controls. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The development and deployment of manned and unmanned satellites has enhanced the collection of remotely sensed data and offers an inexpensive way to obtain information over large areas.

This paper reviews the current status of selected remote sensing algorithms for estimating LST from thermal infrared (TIR) data. A brief theoretical background of the subject is presented along with a survey of the algorithms employed for obtaining LST from space-based TIR measurements. The discussion focuses on TIR data acquired from polar-orbiting satellites because of their widespread use, global applicability and higher spatial resolution compared to geostationary satellites. The theoretical framework and methodologies used to derive the LST from the data are reviewed followed by the methodologies for validating satellite-derived LST. Directions for future research to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived LST are then suggested.},

abstract = {Remote sensing is a useful tool for identifying the surface expression of geothermal systems based on characteristic mineral assemblages that result from hydrothermal alteration (Kratt et al., 2004; Vaughan et al., 2005). Buffalo Valley in Pershing and Lander Counties, Nevada, is an area of high potential for geothermal energy production (Shevenell et al., 2004). Geothermal heat is expressed by several hot springs with surface temperatures of up to 79ºC (Olmsted et al., 1975). The hot springs and a chain of Quaternary cinder cones appear to be structurally controlled by a fault zone related to the Fish Creek Mountains range front fault (Olmsted et al., 1975; Wollenberg et al., 1975). The full extent of the geothermal system in Buffalo Valley is poorly understood. Remote sensing is used as an attempt to better constrain the system and explore for hidden geothermal systems in other parts of the valley. The MASTER airborne simulator acquired data over Buffalo Valley and Jersey Valley in May 2006. MASTER simulates a combination of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instruments. MASTER data have 11 m spatial resolution and 50 channels ranging from the visible to thermal infrared (0.4 to 12.9 $\mu$m). The relatively high spatial and spectral resolution of the data allows for the identification of carbonate, sulfate, silica and clay minerals. Quartz- and clay-rich regions of Buffalo Valley were determined using methods that exploit differences in thermal infrared emissivity. MASTER visible and short-wave infrared data further define the mineralogy of areas with geothermal potential. The MASTER data show the active Buffalo Valley Hot Springs region consists mostly of carbonate deposits. Further from the hot springs, silica-rich deposits surround the carbonates. This paper presents initial mapping results of geothermal materials.},

We identified minerals such as alunite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite through analysis of hyperspectral data indicating regions of hydrothermally altered rock associated with areas of geothermal potential. Tertiary volcanic and granitic rocks also contain these indicator minerals. Quaternary environments displayed gypsum-bearing evaporite crusts that we postulate were deposited by sulfate-rich thermal waters. Throughout the PLPTL, tufa towers and tufa shoreline deposits are extensively distributed as remnants of paleo-lake Lahontan. Based on measured spectra of calcium carbonate, we mapped tufa towers elucidating the strike direction of associated faults. Additionally, we correlated remotely-derived maps of shoreline tufa deposits with climate-related changes in lake level. Our mapping results helped guide detailed exploration efforts to areas with the most geothermal potential. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Fracture zones on the Earth's surface are important elements in the understanding of plate motion forces, the dynamics of the subsurface fluid flow, and earthquake distributions. However, good exposures of these features are always lacking in arid regions, characterized by flat topography and where sand dunes extensively cover the terrain. During field surveys these conditions, in many cases, hinder the proper characterization of such features. Therefore, an approach that identifies the regional fractures as lineaments on remotely-sensed images or shaded digital terrain models, with its large scale synoptic coverage, could be promising. In the present work, a segment tracing algorithm (STA), for lineament detection from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery, and the data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30 m digital elevation model (DEM), has been applied in the Siwa region, located in the northwest of the Western Desert of Egypt. The objectives are to analyze the spatial variation in orientation of the detected linear features and its relation to the hydrogeologic setting in the area and the underlying geology, and to evaluate the performance of the algorithm applied to the ETM+ and the DEM data. Detailed structural analysis and better understanding of the tectonic evolution of the area could provide useful tools for hydrologists for reliable groundwater management and development planning. The results obtained have been evaluated by the structural analysis of the area and field observations. Four major vertical fracture zones were detected corresponding to two conjugate sets of strike-slip faults that governed the surface, and subsurface environments of the lakes in the region, and these correlate well with the regional tectonics. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Geothermal reservoirs are usually located at a depth range of 2 to 5 km, so to efficiently utilize such resources an advanced prospecting method is needed to detect these deep geologic structures. This study aimed to three-dimensionally characterize geothermal reservoirs by a combination of Magnetotelluric (MT) survey, inversion analysis of apparent resistivity, and interpolation of the resistivity data obtained. The western side of Mt. Aso crater, southwest Japan, was chosen as the case study area. Three hot springs exist there and a fault is assumed to go in the direction connecting them. A MT survey was carried out at 26 sites and the data processed by a remote reference method to reduce artificial noises. Based on skewness and Mohr circle analyses of the impedance tensor, the local geologic structure at each site could be approximated as horizontally layered and therefore, a one-dimensional inversion analysis was applied to the MT raw data. The resultant resistivity column data were then interpolated by the three-dimensional optimization principle method. The resistivity distributions obtained clarified continuous conductors with especially low resistivity (less than 10 $\Omega$·m) at the hot springs along the fault. Because the resistivity decreases largely with an abundance of clay minerals, the conductors could be considered to correspond with the cap rocks. Thus, two geothermal reservoirs, whose shapes were estimated to be pillar, were detected under the cap rocks in an elevation range of - 1000 to - 3000 m. By comparing the resistivity distributions with the temperature distributions based on fluid-flow calculations at a steady state using FEM, the validity of the location and dimension of the estimated reservoirs were confirmed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

For reducing the atmospheric effect, a multivariate regression method is developed by combining the digital number (DN) of band 6 with the oceanic and atmospheric parameters that are geometric coordinate, water depth, air temperature, and aerological humidity in the SONDE data. High estimation accuracy of the proposed method is demonstrated through cross-validation using the 220 in situ SST data. Seasonal change patterns of the SST in a year and also temporal changes from 1987 to 2000 are clarified by applying the method. The temporal change pattern of the SST is found to be similar to the precipitation within the last two months and also the air temperature except for Nov.2, 1997 data, which is probably affected by El Nino.},

abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25–30°C per kilometer depth, however in active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150°C per kilometer depth can be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hot water is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles are evidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling and drying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper we review the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from the traditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirect detection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat fluxes, geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to published remote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions, mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from the La Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between various surface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute to exploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached full maturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework. A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and the present contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number of question lines: ‘how reproducible are remote sensing products’, ‘can long term monitoring of geothermal systems be achieved’ and ‘do surface manifestations link to subsurface features’?},

abstract = {Multispectral satellite data recorded in the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) region have been used to estimate temperatures of hot volcanic features such as fumaroles and lava bodies. This has required the assumption that thermal distributions across the surfaces in question can be adequately represented by a very few (usually two) temperature components. We investigate here the applicability of such simple descriptions to fumarole fields, an important class of thermal phenomena. Our surface temperature surveys, conducted at Momotombo (Nicaragua) and Vulcano (Italy), suggest that SWIR emission from the interiors of high-temperature fumarole vents far exceeds that from their surroundings. In contrast, cooling crust on active lava bodies can contribute more SWIR radiation than the small areas of exposed incandescent material that are often present. Such a distinction should be discernible in the relative response of the two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) SWIR bands, providing a basis for identification of the volcanic nature of thermal anomalies in Landsat TM or similar data, even in the absence of field observations. However, estimates of subpixel temperatures and heat flux, made from such satellite data, must be considered unreliable.},

abstract = {Simulating a rock fracture distribution is an important problem common to various fields in geosciences. This paper presents GEOFRAC, a geostatistical method to simulate a fracture distribution by incorporating the directions (strikes and dips) of the sampled fracture data into the simulation. Fracture locations are generated randomly following fracture densities assigned by a sequential Gaussian simulation. Fracture directions are transformed into an indicator set consisting of several binary (0 and 1) variables and the variables are compressed using the principal component analysis. Ordinary kriging is then employed to estimate the distributions of these principal values and the results are back-transformed into the coordinate system of the original indicator set. Fracture directions are generated randomly using their histograms within the defined directional interval. Finally, facets (fracture elements) are determined from the simulated locations and directions, and the fractures within the angle and distance tolerances are connected to form a fracture plane. From a case study of applying GEOFRAC to the fracture data in Kikuma granite, southwest Japan, GEOFRAC was shown to be able to depict a plausible fracture system because the simulated directions corresponded well to those measured. Furthermore, the simulated fracture system was available to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the study site, which was roughly in agreement with the average of hydraulic test results.},

abstract = {Air surface temperature (T air) is an important parameter for a wide range of applications such as vector-borne disease bionomics, hydrology and climate change studies. Air temperature data is usually obtained from measurements made in meteorological stations, providing only limited information about spatial patterns over wide areas. The use of remote sensing data can help overcome this problem, particularly in areas with low station density, having the potential to improve the estimation of T air at both regional and global scales. Some studies have tried to derive maximum (T max), minimum (T min) and average air temperature (T avg) using different methods, with variable estimation accuracy; errors generally fall in the 2-3??C range while the level of precision generally considered as accurate is 1-2??C. The main objective of this study was to accurately estimate T max, T min and T avg for a 10year period based on remote sensing-Land Surface Temperature (LST) data obtained from MODIS-and auxiliary data using a statistical approach. An optimization procedure with a mixed bootstrap and jackknife resampling was employed. The statistical models estimated Tavg with a MEF (Model Efficiency Index) of 0.941 and a RMSE of 1.33??C. Regarding T max and T min, the best MEF achieved was 0.919 and 0.871, respectively, with a 1.83 and 1.74??C RMSE. The developed datasets provided weekly 1km estimations and accurately described both the intra and inter annual temporal and spatial patterns of T air. Potential sources of uncertainty and error were also analyzed and identified. The most promising developments were proposed with the aim of developing accurate T air estimations at a larger scale in the future. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {If energy security is defined as the availability of energy at all times in various forms, in sufficient quantities and at affordable prices, without unacceptable or irreversible impact on the economy and the environment, Japan is facing an energy security predicament. For a country that was already uneasy about energy security, the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which caused a nuclear catastrophe in TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, turned this unease into outright anxiety. With the temporary and/or permanent closure of many nuclear reactors Japan has had to replace lost power. Tokyo has had no choice but to secure additional fossil fuels, a strategy that has negatively affected Japan's economy due to rising fuel costs. The increase in Japan's fossil fuel consumption has also caused a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, and affected Tokyo's commitment to Kyoto targets. This paper analyzes the consequences of the 2011 nuclear disaster for Japan's energy security. Recognizing that Japan's future energy policy choices are constrained and path dependent, the paper outlines energy policy recommendations for Japan's government. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We analyse shortwave infrared thermal data of the phase 1 eruption of Unzen Volcano (Japan) extracted from eight nighttime Thematic Mapper (TM) images taken from the Landsat 5 satellite between October 1991 and November 1992. We identify two discrete regions of the dome that were heated to high temperature by the ongoing eruptive activity; a fumarolically heated region and an area associated with the effusion of new lava. We concentrate analysis on the fumarolically heated region and investigate the relationships between parameters derived from the infrared radiance data and the nature of the fumarolic gas and magma fluxes. Temporal variations in the parameters derived from the radiance data closely follow those observed in the measured rate of magma effusion. The positive correlation observed between the fumarolically driven shortwave infrared flux and the magma discharge rate (r2 = 0.64) indicates that degassing occurred efficiently and in proportion to the amount of magma supplied. Over our monitoring period, the data suggest that gas accumulation within the edifice did not occur, this conclusion agreeing with a previous finding obtained using correlation spectrometer (COSPEC) analysis of SO2 flux rates. A positive correlation (r2 = 0.56) was also found between the mean radiance of the pixels in the fumarolically heated region and the overall size of that region. This suggests a potential mechanism whereby, when gas pressure within the edifice increased, excess gas escaped through additional pathways to the surface as well through an increased flux at the main fumarolic vents.},

Public domain data are available from the newly operational Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). This paper presents an adjustment of the split window algorithm (SWA) for TIRS that uses atmospheric transmittance and land surface emissivity (LSE) as inputs. Various alternatives for estimating these SWA inputs are reviewed, and a sensitivity analysis of the SWA to misestimating the input parameters is performed. The accuracy of the current development was assessed using simulated Modtran data. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the simulated LST was calculated as 0.93 °C. This SWA development is leading to progress in the determination of LST by Landsat-8 TIRS.},

The database consists of 1200 borehole logs including geologic columns,in situ test results, ground-water level, water quality data, and resistivity logs. The Kumamoto plain, situated in southwest Japan, is chosen as a study area. The evaluation process consists of two steps: (1) modeling of shapes of water-bearing strata, and (2) modeling of distribution of physical quantity which has some relationship with the porosity of those strata. In step (1), the shapes of upper and/or lower surface of the pyroclastic flow deposits and the andesitic lava were determined, whereas the three-dimensional distribution model of resistivity was constructed from resistivity logging data obtained from 100 boreholes and using the proposed interpolation method in the step (2). An empirical equation between the porosity and the resistivity of the lava was also identified. The integration of two types of model and the empirical equation contributed to an estimate of the total volume of the ground-water under the study area.},

abstract = { Airborne hyperspectral technology' has progressed to global implementation possibilities for geothermal exploration and assessment. This work describes the unique capabilities of hyperspectral imagers as they pertain to the mapping and characterization of geothermal regions including both geological and biological material mapping. Many of the geological processes, phenomena and products (such as alteration) associated with regions of high geothermal gradients can be imaged, measured, geospatially placed and identified accurately and precisely over large, contiguous areas in virtually any region of the globe by aircraft-mounted imaging spectrometers such as HyMap. For example traditional drilling and field surveys provide extensive mineralogical data at depth and over very small areas. Such activities are considered mandatory in any geothermal exploration program. However hyperspectral remote sensing has the capability to accurately map continuous surface mineralogy over very large areas at small spatial scales (eg. siliceous sinter, travertine or alunite distribution). While resource satellites such as Landsat and ASTER do provide global coverage of basic geology at relatively low spatial resolutions (15-30 m) and low spectral resolutions (40-700 nm), directed high spatial and spectral resolution airborne surveys with HyMap (3-5 m spatial and 13-17 nm spectral) afford incomparable material map generation capabilities. These include not only the specific mineral identification maps discussed above, but also mineral chemistry measurements, proxy temperature estimates and associated geobotanical measurements and distribution maps (that include not only types of vegetation but also relative physiological state).},

abstract = {Remote sensing provides a broad view of landscapes and can be consistent through time, making it an important tool for monitoring and managing protected areas. An impediment to broader use of remote sensing science for monitoring has been the need for resource managers to understand the specialized capabilities of an ever-expanding array of image sources and analysis techniques. Here, we provide guidelines that will enable land managers to more effectively collaborate with remote sensing scientists to develop and apply remote sensing science to achieve monitoring objectives. We first describe fundamental characteristics of remotely sensed data and change detection analysis that affect the types and range of phenomena that can be tracked. Using that background, we describe four general steps in natural resource remote sensing projects: image and reference data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, and evaluation. We emphasize the practical considerations that arise in each of these steps. We articulate a four-phase process that guides natural resource and remote sensing specialists through a collaborative process to articulate goals, evaluate data and options for image processing, refine or eliminate unrealistic paths, and assess the cost and utility of different options. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of burned areas in Rond\^{o}nia State, Brazil during the years 2000 to 2011 and evaluate the burned area maps. A Linear Spectral Mixture Model (\{LSMM\}) was applied to \{MODIS\} surface reflectance images to originate the burned areas maps, which were validated with \{TM\}/Landsat 5 and \{ETM\}+/Landsat 7 images and field data acquired in August 2013. The validation presented a correlation ranging from 67\% to 96\% with an average value of 86\%. The lower correlation values are related to the distinct spatial resolutions of the \{MODIS\} and \{TM\}/\{ETM\}+ sensors because small burn scars are not detected in \{MODIS\} images and higher spatial correlations are related to the presence of large fires, which are better identified in \{MODIS\}, increasing the accuracy of the mapping methodology. In addition, the 12-year burned area maps of Rond\^{o}nia indicate that fires, as a general pattern, occur in areas that have already been converted to some land use, such as vegetal extraction, large animal livestock areas or diversified permanent crops. Furthermore, during the analyzed period, land use conversion associated with climatic events significantly influenced the occurrence of fire in Rond\^{o}nia and amplified its impacts.},

abstract = {Exploration for volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits of the kuroko-type is underway in many places. Clarifying the spatial patterns of the metals in kuroko deposits will be useful for understanding their genetic mechanisms and for future exploration of such types of deposits. This study represents a spatial distribution analysis on the contents of principal metals of kuroko deposits: Cu, Pb, and Zn, in the Hokuroku district, northern Japan, by a feedforward neural network and 1917 sample data at 143 drillhole sites. The network, which consists of three layers, was trained by the principle of SLANS in which the numbers of neurons in the middle layer and training data are changed to improve estimation accuracy. Using the weight coefficients connecting adjacent neurons, sensitivity analysis of the neural network was carried out to identify factors influencing spatial distributions of the three metals. The coordinates depth (z) direction, Bouguer gravity, and specific lithology such as dacite were determined to be influencing factors. The high frequency of the z coordinate signifies that the metal contents differ to a large extent by depth. The sensitivity vector was defined using sensitivity coefficients for x, y, and z coordinates of an estimation point. We determined that the directions of large vectors were different inside and outside of the Hanawa-Ohdate area. This characteristic is considered to originate from the differences in the permeability of fractures that became the paths for rising ore solutions, and the depths that the solutions mixed with sea water.

In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hotwater is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles areevidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling anddrying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper wereview the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from thetraditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirectdetection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat luxes,geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to publishedremote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions,mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from theLa Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between varioussurface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute toexploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached fullmaturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework.A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and thepresent contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number ofquestion lines: 'how reproducible are remote sensing products', 'can long term monitoring of geothermalsystems be achieved' and 'do surface manifestations link to subsurface features'? © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

A further 75 MW geothermoelectric were added in 1973, again in Mexico, at Cerro Prieto. Other countries later followed the Mexican example, with the result that the geothermoelectric capacity installed in the developing nations increased rapidly from 462 MW in 1979 to 1495 MW in 1984.

The most interesting examples in Africa are found in the circum-Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Tunisia) and in Asia in China and Turkey. There are no known plants for the direct use of geothermal heat in Latin-America. The progress of geothermal R\&D is very satisfactory in the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia, fairly satisfactory in Kenya, Ethiopia and some Central-American countries such as El Salvador and Nicaragua, but still at very early stages in most of the other countries. Several nations with favourable geological conditions for the development of geothermal resources have just begun, or have still to begin, their reconnaissance work.},

abstract = {Thermal activity monitoring in and around active volcanic areas using remote sensing is an essential part of volcanology nowadays. Three identical approaches were used for thermal activity exploration at Aso volcanic area in Japan using Landsat ETM+images. First, the conventional methods for hydrothermal alteration mapping were applied to find the most active thermal region after exploring geothermal indicator minerals. Second, we found some thermally highly anomalous regions around Nakadake crater using land surface temperature estimation. Then, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation was used for estimating and also monitoring radiative heat flux (RHF) from the most active region of about 8km2 in and around Nakadake crater in the central part of the Aso volcano. To fulfill the required parameter in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux, the NDVI (Normalized differential vegetation index) method was used for spectral emissivity, and the mono-window algorithm was used for land surface temperature of this study area. The NDVI value was used to divide land-cover in the study area into four types: water, bare ground, mixed and vegetated land. The bare land was found within the most active region. Vegetation coverage area showed an inverse relationship with total RHF in this study as health of thermally stressed vegetation supports this relationship. The spatial distribution of spectral emissivity ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 in our study. Land surface temperature was estimated using a mono-window algorithm and was highest LST in 2008 and lowest in 2011. The results of RHF showed that the highest pixel RHF was found to be about 296W/m2 in 2008. Total RHF was obtained of about 607MW in 2002 and the lowest was about 354MW in 2008. The RHF anomaly area was found the highest in 2002 and was lowest in 2011. The highest total heat discharge rate (HDR) obtained about 3918MW in 2002 and lowest total HDR about 2289MW in 2008 from this study area. But in the case of Nakadake crater alone, the higher thermal activity was observed in 2008 and was less in 2004. The study showed that Landsat thermal infrared is the best option for thermal activity exploration and monitoring at Aso volcano as well as in any active volcano region considering high efficiency and low cost.},

abstract = {The factors determining the suitability of limestone for industrial use and its commercial value are the amounts of calcium oxide (CaO) and impurities. From 244 sample points in 18 drillhole sites in a limestone mine, southwestern Japan, data on four impurity elements, SiO2, Fe2O3, MnO, and P2O5 were collected. It generally is difficult to estimate spatial distributions of these contents, because most of the limestone bodies in Japan are located in the accretionary complex lithologies of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age. Because the spatial correlations of content data are not clearly shown by variogram analysis, a feedforward neural network was applied to estimate the content distributions. The network structure consists of three layers: input, middle, and output. The input layer has 17 neurons and the output layer four. Three neurons in the input layer correspond with x, y, z coordinates of a sample point and the others are rock types such as crystalline and conglomeratic limestones, and fossil types related to the geologic age of the limestone. Four neurons in the output layer correspond to the amounts of SiO2, Fe2O3, MnO, and P2O5. Numbers of neurons in the middle layer and training data differ with each estimation point to avoid the overfitting of the network. We could detect several important characteristics of the three-dimensional content distributions through the network such as a continuity of low content zones of SiO2 along a Lower Permian fossil zone trending NE-SW, and low-quality zones located in depths shallower than 50 m. The capability of the neural network-based method compared with the geostatistical method is demonstrated from the viewpoints of estimation errors and spatial characteristics of multivariate data. To evaluate the uncertainty of estimates, a method that draws several outputs by changing coordinates slightly from the target point and inputting them to the same trained network is proposed. Uncertainty differs with impurity elements, and is not based on just the spatial arrangement of data points.},

abstract = {The Landsat program has been producing an archive of thermal imagery that spans the globe and covers 30 years of the thermal history of the planet at human scales 
(60–120 m). Most of that archive’s absolute radiometric calibration has been fixed through vicarious calibration techniques. These calibration ties to trusted values have often taken a year or more to gather sufficient data and, in some cases, it has been over a decade before calibration certainty has been established. With temperature being such a critical factor for all living systems and the ongoing concern over the impacts of climate change, NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are leading efforts to provide timely and accurate temperature data from the Landsat thermal data archive. This paper discusses two closely related advances that are critical steps toward providing timely and reliable temperature image maps from Landsat. The first advance involves the development and testing of an autonomous procedure for gathering and performing initial screening of large amounts of vicarious calibration data. The second advance discussed in this paper is the 
per-pixel atmospheric compensation of the data to permit calculation of the emitted surface radiance (using ancillary sources of emissivity data) and the corresponding land surface temperature (LST).},

abstract = {Geothermal reservoirs are usually located at a depth range of 2 to 5 km, so to efficiently utilize such resources an advanced prospecting method is needed to detect these deep geologic structures. This study aimed to three-dimensionally characterize geothermal reservoirs by a combination of Magnetotelluric (MT) survey, inversion analysis of apparent resistivity, and interpolation of the resistivity data obtained. The western side of Mt. Aso crater, southwest Japan, was chosen as the case study area. Three hot springs exist there and a fault is assumed to go in the direction connecting them. A MT survey was carried out at 26 sites and the data processed by a remote reference method to reduce artificial noises. Based on skewness and Mohr circle analyses of the impedance tensor, the local geologic structure at each site could be approximated as horizontally layered and therefore, a one-dimensional inversion analysis was applied to the MT raw data. The resultant resistivity column data were then interpolated by the three-dimensional optimization principle method. The resistivity distributions obtained clarified continuous conductors with especially low resistivity (less than 10 $\Omega$·m) at the hot springs along the fault. Because the resistivity decreases largely with an abundance of clay minerals, the conductors could be considered to correspond with the cap rocks. Thus, two geothermal reservoirs, whose shapes were estimated to be pillar, were detected under the cap rocks in an elevation range of - 1000 to - 3000 m. By comparing the resistivity distributions with the temperature distributions based on fluid-flow calculations at a steady state using FEM, the validity of the location and dimension of the estimated reservoirs were confirmed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Assemblage of main fracture and subordinate fractures form a fracture zone. Geometry, orientation, and permeability of fracture zone are significant factors for exploration and assessment of geothermal resources. Because these fracture attributes, which have an effect on the hydrothermal system represented by flow pattern and physical condition of hot fluids, are difficult to be clarified on a field scale, a combination of several methods is required for the fracture-zone characterization. This paper presents a case study of this characterization on the Aso caldera in southwestern Japan. The study consists of the three parts, lineament analysis, numerical simulation, and geophysical survey. Lineaments are derived from SPOT panchromatic imagery and used to calculate azimuths and dips of the major fractures associated with the origin of hot springs. A numerical simulation using finite element method is aimed at estimating the configuration and permeability of the fracture zone, formed by a gathering of the major fractures. By this calculation, the fracture zone was inferred to consist of two prisms that incline at angles of 70?-80? in the opposite direction of the mountain slope, and have permeability, 102 greater than that of the country, volcanic rocks. Moreover, the radon survey using scintillation counter method and soil gas near the fumaroles has been conducted to investigate the temporal changes of radon concentrations at the three sites, located on the two prisms. A difference in the temporal change patterns among the sites may result from the physical conditions of the hydrothermal fluids ascending through the prisms.},

abstract = {The accurate imaging of geothermal systems from the ground surface down to great depths is an interdisciplinary problem common to geothermal resource exploration and development. Rocks can be characterized mainly in terms of their lithology, mineralogy, fracture distribution, permeability, thermal conductivity and porosity, and similarly the geothermal fluid (and its circulation) by its geochemistry, flow pattern, velocity, temperature and pressure. Some of these data are obtained by well logging and from laboratory tests conducted on drillhole cores. In general, the distribution of geothermal wells is not random, and well data are limited in terms of quantity and depth range. Accordingly, a sophisticated spatial modeling technique is indispensable in the three-dimensional imaging of geothermal systems. We describe a versatile 3-D modeling method that can be used to determine the temperature, flow velocity, and distribution of geological units within a geothermal field based on well log data. The model results for the Hohi geothermal area, Japan, provide plausible estimates of temperature, flow velocity, and geology to a depth of 3000 m. Superimposition of the three spatial models we obtained shows that, at Hohi, two geothermal reservoirs are localized near highly fractured fault zones that provide paths for the ascent of thermal fluids from depth. ?? 2007 CNR.},

abstract = {Characterization of the sediment composition of tidal flats and monitoring of their spatiotemporal changes has become an important part of the sustainable management of coastal environments. To accurately classify sediments through remote sensing, a comprehensive understanding of sediment reflectance spectra is indispensable. The present laboratory-based study explores the performance of the high spatial resolution (10 × 10 m) Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) launched in 2006. Relationships between reflectance spectra (bands 1 to 4) and four typical mass physical properties were investigated under wet and dry experimental conditions for intertidal sediments sampled near the Ba Lat Estuary in northern Vietnam. Reflectance in the near-infrared region corresponding to ALOS band 4 (0.76–0.89 $\mu$m) was found (1) to have a strong negative correlation with sand content (dry wt\%) under both wet and dry conditions (linear correlation coefficient r = –0.7859 and –0.8094, respectively), (2) to increase with decreasing relative water content (\%) in a given sediment type (r = –0.7748 to –0.9367 for mud, sandy mud, muddy sand, and sand), (3) to have a positive correlation with organic matter content (r = 0.7610 and 0.6460 under wet and dry conditions for contents >0.20 dry wt\%), and (4) to be insignificantly correlated with mineral composition assessed in terms of contents (wt\%) of quartz, clay minerals, and mica group minerals. Positive relationships between reflectance and water content for the pooled data of all sediment types (r = 0.6395) or organic matter content contrast with previous findings, and can be attributed to close interrelationships between these properties and the predominance of sand content as controlling factor of reflectance. This study clarifies that ALOS band 4 provides the most useful imagery for intertidal monitoring because its reflectance, as simulated using the laboratory data, shows the strongest correlation with sand content. In a next step, these experimental findings should be verified by identifying the reflectance relationships at satellite image scales, and also considering the effects of other tidal flat features on reflectance, such as microtopography and biological surface characteristics.},

abstract = {Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) are currently operational for routine Earth observation. There are substantial differences between instruments onboard both satellites. The enhancements achieved with Landsat-8 refer to the scanning technology (replacing of whisk-broom scanners with two separate push-broom OLI and TIRS scanners), an extended number of spectral bands (two additional bands provided) and narrower bandwidths. Therefore, cross-comparative analysis is very necessary for the combined use of multi-decadal Landsat imagery. In this study, 3,311 independent sample points of four major land cover types (primary forest, unplanted cropland, swidden cultivation and water body) were used to compare the spectral bands of ETM+ and OLI. Eight sample plots with different land cover types were manually selected for comparison with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). These indices were calculated with six pairs of ETM+ and OLI cloud-free images, which were acquired over the border area of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand just two days apart, when Landsat-8 achieved operational obit. Comparative results showed that: (1) the average surface reflectance of each band differed slightly, but with a high degree of similarities between both sensors. In comparison with ETM+, the OLI had higher values for the near-infrared band for vegetative land cover types, but lower values for non-vegetative types. The new sensor had lower values for the shortwave infrared (2.11–2.29 µm) band for all land cover types. In addition, it also basically had higher values for the shortwave infrared (1.57–1.65 µm) band for non-water land cover types. (2) The subtle differences of vegetation indices derived from both sensors and their high linear correlation coefficient (R2},

The MIU is located in crystalline rock environment, in Mizunami City, central Japan. Field investigations include geological mapping, reflection seismic surveys, several borehole investigations and geological investigations in the research galleries to identify the distribution and heterogeneity of fractures and faults that are potential major flowpaths for groundwater. The results of these field investigations are synthesized and compiled for the purpose of geological modeling. The field investigations indicate that the Main Shaft at the MIU intersected low permeability NNW oriented faults. A high permeability fracture zone in the granite, a significant water inflow point, was observed in the Ventilation Shaft. Development of the geological model focusing 3D spatial relationships at different scales and evolution of the geoenvironment are underway. This paper describes geological investigations applied in the MIU project, focusing on the evaluation of their effectiveness to understand for deep underground geoenviroment.},

abstract = {This study aimed at clarifying the relationship between the dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) changes and decline in the groundwater levels, and specifying an LULC category strongly affecting such decline in a Quaternary sedimentary basin. Groundwater level data recorded at 26 observation wells for a 14-year period in the Kumamoto Plain, central Kyushu, southwest Japan, were used for the analysis. The general trends of LULC were detected by a satellite image classification technique and surface spline method, which highlighted the decreases in groundwater-recharge materials. As the next step, those trends of groundwater levels that were closely correlated with rainfall were removed from the level data set, and the resultant residual component levels were applied to co-kriging analysis with LULC categories. Co-kriging provided a detailed map of groundwater level variability. Furthermore, we propose a method, prediction of residual of groundwater level (PWL), to infer future residual groundwater levels from the supposed LULC pattern by co-kriging-based modeling. PWL was demonstrated to be effective because it clearly represented the decrease and increase in negative residual level areas, depending on the extent of rice fields in the past and in predicted future distribution scenarios.},

abstract = {This study examines two mapping method's sensitivity to the sampling density of the variable of interest, which is the thickness of a silty-clay–loam (TSCL) horizon. The two methods are simple linear regression (SLR) and universal kriging with external drift (UKEXD). As slope gradient ($\beta$) derived from a DEM, is available for the whole study area and linearly related to TSCL horizon, was used for TSCL prediction by SLR and by UKEXD. The accuracy performance of TSCL prediction using these methods was assessed by comparison with another group of 69 sample points (validation sample) where the TSCL is actually measured. In the validation procedure for the two methods, two indices were calculated from the validation sample (measured values) and predicted values. These two indices are the mean error (ME) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that UKEXD was more accurate than the SLR. The improvement of the accuracy of the prediction from SLR to UKEXD was about 38\%. To examine the effect of sampling density of TSCL (variable of interest) on the performance of both mapping methods, five subsets of 40, 50, 75, 100 and 125 observation sites of TSCL were randomly selected from the 150 sites of the prediction sample. For each subset, a prediction of TSCL was performed over the study area by: (i) SLR; (ii) UKEXD. The validation sample was used to compare the performance of the two methods according to the sample size of the variable of interest. The results show that whatever the sample size may be, UKEXD performs on average more accurate predictions than SLR. Moreover, the results indicate that UKEXD performed better when the sample size of the variable of interest increases. On the contrary, the performances with the linear regression remain stable whatever the sample size may be.},

abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) are developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA is responsible for building and launching the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185. km swath with a 30. m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15. m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100. m resolution over a 185. km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite "Landsat 8" following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Downward continuation operators are derived and used to calculate the subsurface temperature from surface heat flow data. If the distribution of the shallow heat sources were known, their effect on the temperature field could be included in the downward continuation operator. The distribution of heat sources with depth can be estimated from the Fourier spectral content of the heat flow data, but the relationship is non-unique. Several operators have been derived with different assumptions regarding the relationship between the wavelength of the surface heat flow variations and the depth of the corresponding heat sources. These downward continuation operators were applied to determine the subsurface temperature and the deep heat flow beneath the Colorado Plateau; the calculations show that the temperature in the crust beneath the plateau is lower than in the surrounding Basin and Range and Rio Grande Rift Provinces. However, the temperature is locally higher in regions of recent tectonic or magmatic activity. The same downward continuation operators can also be used to model the effect of hydrothermal convection on the temperature field. An example is presented where closely spaced heat flow data from the Juan de Fuca Ridge have been used to calculate the crustal temperature and to estimate the heat flow below the convecting layer.},
