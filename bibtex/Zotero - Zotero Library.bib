abstract = {This paper presents a summary of a laboratory and field research program designed to evaluate the application of remote sensing techniques to geothermal exploration and development. The primary objective was to establish the feasibility of performing initial reconnaissance of an unmapped area with airborne or spacecraft remote sensors. The field experiments were conducted against a series of known geothermal regions in California. These regions were chosen to represent a typical range of geologic and environmental settings. It was attempted to relate remotely sensed and in-situ geophysical measurements of representative geothermal regions through a diurnal and seasonal range of variation. Effects of varying flight altitude on thermal anomaly « signatures \aa are also presented. Multiband photography in the visible and near infra-red was used to delineate anomalous spectral reflectance associated with hydrothermal alteration zones, passive \{\{IR\}\} imagery and radiometry in the 8 to 14 $\mu$ band, as well as passive microwave radiometry at 16 and 19 \{\{GHz\}\} was used to detect combined temperature and emissivity anomalies. Preliminary laboratory studies of field samples served to define the sensor passbands to be employed and permit later interpretation of observed effects. Ground controls on the experiment included detailed thermometric, gravity, magnetic and subsurface heat flow mapping. The major results of this investigation may be summarized as the identification of temperature anomalies in not only the infrared; but also the microwave, Rayleigh-Jeans region of the spectrum. Subsidiary conclusions were the uniform presence of visible alteration haloes, soil moisture anomalies, and apparent structural control of the thermal zones. While these techniques were applied in the nature of a controlled experiment, the results are considered generally applicable to related problems of geologic reconnaissance.},

abstract = {Remote sensing is a useful tool for identifying the surface expression of geothermal systems based on characteristic mineral assemblages that result from hydrothermal alteration (Kratt et al., 2004; Vaughan et al., 2005). Buffalo Valley in Pershing and Lander Counties, Nevada, is an area of high potential for geothermal energy production (Shevenell et al., 2004). Geothermal heat is expressed by several hot springs with surface temperatures of up to 79ºC (Olmsted et al., 1975). The hot springs and a chain of Quaternary cinder cones appear to be structurally controlled by a fault zone related to the Fish Creek Mountains range front fault (Olmsted et al., 1975; Wollenberg et al., 1975). The full extent of the geothermal system in Buffalo Valley is poorly understood. Remote sensing is used as an attempt to better constrain the system and explore for hidden geothermal systems in other parts of the valley. The MASTER airborne simulator acquired data over Buffalo Valley and Jersey Valley in May 2006. MASTER simulates a combination of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instruments. MASTER data have 11 m spatial resolution and 50 channels ranging from the visible to thermal infrared (0.4 to 12.9 $\mu$m). The relatively high spatial and spectral resolution of the data allows for the identification of carbonate, sulfate, silica and clay minerals. Quartz- and clay-rich regions of Buffalo Valley were determined using methods that exploit differences in thermal infrared emissivity. MASTER visible and short-wave infrared data further define the mineralogy of areas with geothermal potential. The MASTER data show the active Buffalo Valley Hot Springs region consists mostly of carbonate deposits. Further from the hot springs, silica-rich deposits surround the carbonates. This paper presents initial mapping results of geothermal materials.},

These analyses are produced weekly and daily using optimum interpolation (OI) on a 1° grid. The OI technique requires the specification of data and analysis error statistics. these statistics are derived and show that the SST rms data errors from ships are almost twice as large as the data errors from buoys or satellites.

abstract = {Surface temperature serves as a key boundary condition that defines the partitioning of surface radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes. Surface brightness temperature measurements from satellites offer the unique possibility of mapping surface heat fluxes at regional scales. Because uncertainties in satellite measurements of surface radiometric temperature arise from atmospheric corrections, surface emissivity, and instrument calibrations, a number of studies have found significant discrepancies between modeled and measured heat fluxes when using radiometric temperature. Recent research efforts have overcome these uncertainties and in addition have accounted for the difference between radiometric and aerodynamic temperature by considering soil and vegetative-canopy aerodynamic resistances. The major remaining obstacle to using satellite data for regional heat flux estimation is inadequate density of near-surface air temperature observations. In this paper we describe a simple, operational, double-difference approach for relating surface sensible heat flux to remote observations of surface brightness temperature, vegetative cover and type, and measurements of near-surface wind speed and air temperature from the synoptic weather network. A double difference of the time rate of change in radiometric and air temperature observations is related to heat flux. This double-difference approach reduces both the errors associated with deriving a radiometric temperature and with defining meteorological quantities at large scales. The scheme is simpler than other recent approaches because it requires minimal ground-based data and does not require modeling boundary layer development. The utility of this scheme is tested with ground-based radiometric temperature observations from several arid and subhumid climates with a wide range of vegetative cover and meteorological conditions.},

Our objective was to test if the MODIS SST product can be applied for lakes whose surface areas are large enough to be observed at the MODIS spatial resolution and to compare the satellite-derived lake surface temperatures with in situ measurements. Surface temperatures for Lakes V??nern and V??ttern in Sweden, two of the largest European lakes, are extracted from the MODIS/Terra images for period 2001-2003. The results are analyzed on different quality levels, as all MODIS L2 products are equipped with an additional quality flag. We present temperature development over 2001-2003, and show the capability of the MODIS SST product to couple the known thermodynamical features in the lakes under study, where temperature varies greatly with space and time. These results can complement lake monitoring programs anywhere. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@misc{Silliman1995,
abstract = {Several authors have addressed the question of identifying the location of and quantifying the volume of groundwater/surface water interaction. Utilizing measurement of temperature within the sediments has been suggested as a means of estimating water flux through the sediments. A qualitative version of this method has been applied to identifying locations of communication between a creek and groundwater based upon temperature time series measurements in the water column and the sediments. The discussion presented earlier is extended to a more general solution which allows for incorporation of measured surface temperature (rather than an assumed surface temperature). The mathematical formulation presented is targeted on the quantification of flux across the sediment for conditions of one-dimensional downflow with a constant flux over periods of days to weeks. This technique, based on the assumption that the temperature of the surface water is the primary thermal influence on sediment temperature, is shown to provide an estimate of fluid flux (volume of water per area per time) for flux rates above a critical threshold. The flux threshold depends on a number of factors including thermal diffusivity of the sediments and depth of burial of the temperature measuring device. Based on use of three simple forcing functions for temperature at the surface of the sediments, it is shown that the amplitude of the temperature response in the sediments to a change in temperature in the overlying water column decreases with increasing depth and decreasing flux. Further, the timing of the peak response in the sediments becomes increasingly delayed as depth increases and flux decreases. These observations, combined with consideration of the assumption of one-dimensional flow, lead to suggesting that field design be based on relatively shallow burial (e.g. 5-15 cm) of the device to measure sediment temperatures. Based on these observations, one of the data sets presented earlier is reanalyzed to derive flux estimates. It is shown that a reasonable fit is obtained with a downflow flux of less than 0.03 cm day-1. Independent measurement of hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity provide a range of flux estimates for the same site (although measured in a different year) which are consistent with this value. Based on these results, it is argued that this technique is a reasonable screening tool for use in situations where relatively inexpensive, point estimates of water flux are required within losing reaches of a creek.},

abstract = {Water temperature plays an important role in ecological functioning and in controlling the biogeochemical processes of a water body. Conventional water quality monitoring is expensive and time consuming. It is particularly problematic if the water bodies to be examined are large. Conventional techniques also bring about a high probability of undersampling. Conversely, remote sensing is a powerful tool to assess aquatic systems. The objective of this study was to map the surface water temperature and improve understanding of spatiotemporal variations in a hydroelectric reservoir. In this work, MODIS land-surface temperature (LST) level 2, 1-km nominal resolution data (MOD11L2, version 5) were used. All available clear-sky MODIS/Terra images from 2003 to 2008 were used, resulting in a total of 786 daytime and 473 nighttime images. Descriptive statistics (mean, maximum and minimum) were computed for the historical images to build a time series of daytime and nighttime monthly mean temperatures. The thermal amplitude and anomaly were also computed. In-situ meteorological variables were used from 2003 to 2008 to help understand the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water temperature. The surface energy budget and the depth at which the wind can distribute the heat input of a given surface were also measured. A correlation between daytime and nighttime surface water temperatures and the computed heat fluxes were made. These relationships and the causes of the water surface temperature variability are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) are developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA is responsible for building and launching the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185. km swath with a 30. m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15. m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100. m resolution over a 185. km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite "Landsat 8" following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate a new approach that uses regional/continental MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived forest cover products to calibrate Landsat data for exhaustive high spatial resolution mapping of forest cover and clearing in the Congo River Basin. The approach employs multi-temporal Landsat acquisitions to account for cloud cover, a primary limiting factor in humid tropical forest mapping. A Basin-wide MODIS 250??m Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) percent tree cover product is used as a regionally consistent reference data set to train Landsat imagery. The approach is automated and greatly shortens mapping time. Results for approximately one third of the Congo Basin are shown. Derived high spatial resolution forest change estimates indicate that less than 1\% of the forests were cleared from 1990 to 2000. However, forest clearing is spatially pervasive and fragmented in the landscapes studied to date, with implications for sustaining the region's biodiversity.

abstract = {Data sets used to monitor the Earth's climate indicate that the surface of the Earth warmed from approximately 1910 to 1940, cooled slightly from approximately 1940 to 1970, and then warmed markedly from approximately 1970 onward. The weak cooling apparent in the middle part of the century has been interpreted in the context of a variety of physical factors, such as atmosphere-ocean interactions and anthropogenic emissions of sulphate aerosols. Here we call attention to a previously overlooked discontinuity in the record at 1945, which is a prominent feature of the cooling trend in the mid-twentieth century. The discontinuity is evident in published versions of the global-mean temperature time series, but stands out more clearly after the data are filtered for the effects of internal climate variability. We argue that the abrupt temperature drop of approximately 0.3 degrees C in 1945 is the apparent result of uncorrected instrumental biases in the sea surface temperature record. Corrections for the discontinuity are expected to alter the character of mid-twentieth century temperature variability but not estimates of the century-long trend in global-mean temperatures.},

The surface temperature holds the critical information about the condition of a gear. A new power circulating gear test rig with a multichannel computer data acquisition system was built to develop various sensor technologies for gear surface temperature monitoring. In this paper, gear surface temperature monitoring will be presented by using miniature thermo- couples. Five miniature type-K thermocouples of 125 mm in diameter were embedded under- neath the tooth surface of a spur gear, and real-time surface temperature variations from a wide range of operating conditions were measured. The various effects of load, rotating speed, and meshing point on the surface temperature are discussed. The results attained in this study indicate that the maximum temperature rise occurs on the dedendum, close to the dedendum circle, and the maximum surface temperature difference at the various contact points along the tooth profile was 13 8C.Among the various temperaturemonitoring techniques, the thermocouple is a very reliable and practical means for online gear condition monitoring.},

abstract = {Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) are currently operational for routine Earth observation. There are substantial differences between instruments onboard both satellites. The enhancements achieved with Landsat-8 refer to the scanning technology (replacing of whisk-broom scanners with two separate push-broom OLI and TIRS scanners), an extended number of spectral bands (two additional bands provided) and narrower bandwidths. Therefore, cross-comparative analysis is very necessary for the combined use of multi-decadal Landsat imagery. In this study, 3,311 independent sample points of four major land cover types (primary forest, unplanted cropland, swidden cultivation and water body) were used to compare the spectral bands of ETM+ and OLI. Eight sample plots with different land cover types were manually selected for comparison with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). These indices were calculated with six pairs of ETM+ and OLI cloud-free images, which were acquired over the border area of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand just two days apart, when Landsat-8 achieved operational obit. Comparative results showed that: (1) the average surface reflectance of each band differed slightly, but with a high degree of similarities between both sensors. In comparison with ETM+, the OLI had higher values for the near-infrared band for vegetative land cover types, but lower values for non-vegetative types. The new sensor had lower values for the shortwave infrared (2.11–2.29 µm) band for all land cover types. In addition, it also basically had higher values for the shortwave infrared (1.57–1.65 µm) band for non-water land cover types.

The model chosen is a linear baroclinic spherical primitive equation model containing a zonally symmetric basic state with horizontal and vertical shear. An iterative procedure is developed in which the total diabatic heating resulting from the initial heating by the SST anomaly is calculated via feedbacks between the heating and the dynamic response of the system. Depending on the latitudinal location of the SST anomaly, two major limits of atmospheric response may be identified. The first, the “diabatic limit”, occurs with the SST anomaly embedded in weak low-latitude basic flow and results in a strong enhancement of the initial anomaly response through a vigorous positive dynamics-diabatic beating feedback. Strong teleconnections are evident between low and high l...},

In this study, Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing data for the early growing season and in situ measurement of spectral reflectance are used to determine the value of endmembers including VIsoil and VIveg, with equally weighted RVI and NDVI measures used in combination to minimize the inherent biases in pure NDVI-based FVC. Their ability to improve estimates of grassland FVC is analyzed at different resolutions. These are shown to improve FVC estimates over NDVI-based SMA models using fixed values for the endmembers. Grassland FVC changes for Inner Mongolia, China from 2000 to 2013 are then monitored using the MODIS data.

abstract = {Landsat images are highly preferred to images by MODIS for producing evapotranspiration (ET) maps for specific land use types because of their higher resolution (30 m). However, Landsat images are potentially available only each 16 days, and, with the expected failure of Landsat 5 sometime within the next five years and the questionable likelihood of a thermal sensor on Landsat 8 scheduled for launch in 2012, the prospect of images from Landsat that are useful for application with energy balance determination of evapotranspiration (ET) is less than bright. Therefore, more use of coarse resolution satellite images, such as 1 Ion thermal images from MODIS, will occur. One advantage of MODIS satellites is that images having view angle < -150 are potentially available about each four to five days. Application of METRIC energy balance processes along the Middle Rio Grande of New Mexico using MODIS imagery indicates that one can successfully reproduce monthly and annual ET estimates that were obtained using Landsat imagery. However, spatial fidelity is highly degraded. This paper compares ET images for the Rio Grande region as produced by both MODIS and by Landsat.},

abstract = {Remote sensing data in the thermal infra red (TIR) part of the spectrum provides indirect estimates of water stress - defined as a function of the ratio between actual and potential evaporation rates - at the earth surface. During the first stage of evaporation ("energy limited" evaporation), this ratio is close to one. During the second stage of evaporation ("soil controlled" evaporation) water stress occurs and as a result this ratio drops below one. Recently, methods using TIR data to monitor stress have shifted from establishing empirical relationships between combined vegetation cover/temperature indices and soil moisture status to data assimilation of surface temperature into complex soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models. However, data and expertise are often lacking to widely apply those methods. In this paper we investigate the proof-of-concept of using solely the difference between actual and unstressed surface temperature as a baseline to monitor water stress. The unstressed temperature is the equilibrium temperature of a given surface expressed in potential conditions, computed with an energy balance model. Theoretical, modelling, and experimental documentation of the proof-of-concept are shown for datasets acquired within the frame of two international experiments in semi-arid region. We show that the difference between the observed and the unstressed surface temperatures is almost linearly related to water stress. A sensitivity study is carried out to test the impact of modelling errors on the evaluation of the unstressed temperature. We found that even with inaccurate but realistic values of the surface parameters used to solve the energy balance and compute the unstressed temperature, the observed to unstressed surface temperature difference is still more relevant to detect second-stage processes than the difference between the observed surface temperature and the air temperature. The perspective of using an empirical index based on this difference is also investigated. These results are especially attractive for application based on TIR satellite imagery at a regional scale. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Routine (i.e., daily to weekly) monitoring of surface energy fluxes, particularly evapotranspiration (ET), using satellite observations of radiometric surface temperature has not been feasible at high pixel resolution (i.e., ??? 101-102 m) because of the low frequency in satellite coverage over the region of interest (i.e., approximately every 2 weeks). Cloud cover further reduces the number of useable observations of surface conditions resulting in high-resolution satellite imagery of a region typically being available once a month, which is not very useful for routine ET monitoring. Radiometric surface temperature observations at ??? 1- to 5-km pixel resolution are available multiple times per day from several weather satellites. However, this spatial resolution is too coarse for estimating ET from individual agricultural fields or for defining variations in ET due to land cover changes. Satellite data in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, used for computing vegetation indices, are available at resolutions an order of magnitude smaller than in the thermal-infrared, and hence provide higher resolution information on vegetation cover conditions. A number of studies have exploited the relationship between vegetation indices and radiometric surface temperature for estimating model parameters used in computing spatially distributed fluxes and available moisture. In this paper, the vegetation index-radiometric surface temperature relationship is utilized in a disaggregation procedure for estimating subpixel variation in surface temperature with aircraft imagery collected over the US Southern Great Plains. The disaggregated surface temperatures estimated by this procedure are compared to actual observations at this subpixel resolution. In addition, a remote sensing-based energy balance model is used to compare output using actual versus estimated surface temperatures over a range of pixel resolutions.

abstract = {A highly automated algorithm called vegetation change tracker (VCT) has been developed for reconstructing recent forest disturbance history using Landsat time series stacks (LTSS). This algorithm is based on the spectral-temporal properties of land cover and forest change processes, and requires little or no fine tuning for most forests with closed or near close canopy cover. It was found very efficient, taking 2-3 h on average to analyze an LTSS consisting of 12 or more Landsat images using an average desktop PC. This LTSS-VCT approach has been used to examine disturbance patterns with a biennial temporal interval from 1984 to 2006 for many locations across the conterminous U.S. Accuracy assessment over 6 validation sites revealed that overall accuracies of around 80\% were achieved for disturbances mapped at individual year level. Average user's and producer's accuracies of the disturbance classes were around 70\% and 60\% in 5 of the 6 sites, respectively, suggesting that although forest disturbances were typically rare as compared with no-change classes, on average the VCT detected more than half of those disturbances with relatively low levels of false alarms. Field assessment revealed that VCT was able to detect most stand clearing disturbance events, including harvest, fire, and urban development, while some non-stand clearing events such as thinning and selective logging were also mapped in western U.S. The applicability of the LTSS-VCT approach depends on the availability of a temporally adequate supply of Landsat imagery. To ensure that forest disturbance records can be developed continuously in the future, it is necessary to plan and develop observational capabilities today that will allow continuous acquisition of frequent Landsat or Landsat-like observations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A model for predicting temperature time series for dry and wet land surfaces is described, as part of a larger project to assess the impact of urban development on the temperature of surface runoff and coldwater streams. Surface heat transfer processes on impervious and pervious land surfaces were investigated for both dry and wet weather periods. The surface heat transfer equations were combined with a numerical approximation of the 1-D unsteady heat diffusion equation to calculate pavement and soil temperature profiles to a depth of 10 m. Equations to predict the magnitude of the radiative, convective, conductive and evaporative heat fluxes at a dry or wet surface, using standard climate data as input, were developed. A model for the effect of plant canopies on surface heat transfer was included for vegetated land surfaces. Given suitable climate data, the model can simulate the land surface and sub-surface temperatures continuously throughout a six month time period or for a single rainfall event. Land surface temperatures have been successfully simulated for pavements, bare soil, short and tall grass, a forest, and two agricultural crops (corn and soybeans). The simulations were run for three different locations in US, and different years as imposed by the availability of measured soil temperature and climate data. To clarify the effect of land use on surface temperatures, the calibrated coefficients for each land use and the same soil coefficients were used to simulate surface temperatures for a six year climate data set from Albertville, MN. Asphalt and concrete give the highest surface temperatures, as expected, while vegetated surfaces gave the lowest. Bare soil gives surface temperatures that lie between those for pavements and plant-covered surfaces. The soil temperature model predicts hourly surface temperatures of bare soil and pavement with root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 1-2 ??C, and hourly surface temperatures of vegetation-covered surfaces with RMSEs of 1-3 ??C. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Landsat 7's recent malfunctioning will result in significant gaps in long-term satellite monitoring of Earth, affecting not only the research of the Earth science community but also conservation users of these data. To determine whether or how important Landsat monitoring is for conservation and natural resource management, we reviewed the Landsat program's history with special emphasis on the development of user groups. We also conducted a bibliographic search to determine the extent to which conservation research has been based on Landsat data. Conservation biologists were not an early user group of Landsat data because a) biologists lacked technical capacity--computers and software--to analyze these data; b) Landsat's 1980s commercialization rendered images too costly for biologists' budgets; and c) the broad-scale disciplines of conservation biology and landscape ecology did not develop until the mid-to-late 1980s. All these conditions had changed by the 1990s and Landsat imagery became an important tool for conservation biology. Satellite monitoring and Landsat continuity are mandated by the Land Remote Sensing Act of 1992. This legislation leaves open commercial options. However, past experiments with commercial operations were neither viable nor economical, and severely reduced the quality of monitoring, archiving and data access for academia and the public. Future satellite monitoring programs are essential for conservation and natural resource management, must provide continuity with Landsat, and should be government operated.},

abstract = {Screen temperatures were monitored from May 2001 to April 2003 in an array of 25 sites on the Prince of Wales Icefield, Ellesmere Island, Canada. The observational network covered an area of ca 15 650 km2 and spanned an altitude ranging from 130 to 2010 m above sea level. The spatial array provides a record of near-surface-temperature lapse rates and mesoscale temperature variability on the icefield. The mean daily lapse rate in the 2-year record is - 4.1° C km-1, with an average summer lapse rate of - 4.3° C km-1. Surface-temperature lapse rates in the region are therefore systematically less than the free-air lapse rates that are typically adopted for extrapolations of sea-level temperature to higher altitudes. Steep lapse rates, resembling moist adiabatic rates in the free air (-6 to - 7° C km-1), are more common in summer at our site and are associated with enhanced cyclonic activity (low-pressure and high relative vorticity) and southerly flow aloft. In contrast, northerly, anticyclonic flow prevails when summer lapse rates are weak (above - 2° C km-1). The low surface-temperature lapse rates and their systematic synoptic variability have important implications for applications that require downscaling or extrapolation of surface- or boundary-layer temperatures, such as modelling of glacier mass balance. We illustrate this in an analysis of observed versus modelled snowmelt on the icefield.},

The proposed algorithm takes into account the SEVIRI angular dependence. The numerical values of the split-window coefficients have been obtained from a statistical regression method, using synthetic data. The look-up tables for atmospheric transmission, path radiance, and downward thermal irradiance are calculated with the MODTRAN3 code. The new LST algorithm has been tested with simulated SEVIRI/MSG1 data over a wide range of atmospheric and surface conditions. Comprehensive sensitivity and error analyses have been undertaken to evaluate the performance of the proposed LST algorithm and its dependence on surface properties, the ranges of atmospheric conditions and surface temperatures, and on the noise-equivalent temperature difference. The results show that the algorithm is capable of producing LST with a standard deviation lower than 1.5 K for viewing zenith angles lower than 50??. Since MSG1 is becoming fully operational in 2004, the proposed algorithm will allow MSG1 users to obtain surface temperatures immediately. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Examples include SST fluctuations in the Southern Ocean associated with the Southern Annular Mode, a tripolar pattern of SST anomalies in the North Atlantic associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation, and a pan-Pacific mode known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (with additional contributions from oceanic processes). They may also result from coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions, such as the El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation phenomenon in the tropical Indo-Pacific, the tropical Atlantic Ni\~{n}o, and the cross-equatorial meridional modes in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic.

Applications of SPR-based biosensors range from laboratory assays to continuous or spot monitoring for analytes important in food industries to monitoring for environmental pollutants and agents of bioterrorism. SPR sensors are capable of measuring minute changes in refractive index (RI) to high precision. Changes in temperature affect the materials of the SPR sensor and RI of aqueous sample solutions. Management of the effects of temperature changes on the SPR signal can be achieved by temperature stabilization, compensation, or a combination of both. The multi-channel design described here allows for a reference channel to compensate for bulk RI changes, non-specific binding, and minor temperature variations, while the temperature controller provides the temperature stability necessary for monitoring small changes in RI. The temperature controller also allows for studies of the temperature dependence of molecular interactions and for optimizing detection conditions. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The proper investigation of heating trends, however, requires that we include surface heat content to monitor this aspect of the climate system. Changes in heat content of the Earth's climate are not fully described by temperature alone. Moist enthalpy or, alternatively, equivalent temperature, is more sensitive to surface vegetation properties than is air temperature and therefore more accurately depicts surface heating trends. The microclimates evident at many surface observation sites highlight the influence of land surface characteristics on local surface heating trends. Temperature and equivalent temperature trend differences from 1982-1997 are examined for surface sites in the Eastern U.S. Overall trend differences at the surface indicate equivalent temperature trends are relatively warmer than temperature trends in the Eastern U.S. Seasonally, equivalent temperature trends are relatively warmer than temperature trends in winter and are relatively cooler in the fall. These patterns, however, vary widely from site to site, so local microclimate is very important. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The results for three 150. ??. 150. km WELD tiles encompassing rectangular, circular (center-pivot irrigation) and irregularly shaped fields in Texas, California and South Dakota are presented and compared to independent United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) cropland data layer (CDL) classifications. Coherent fields that are visually apparent were extracted with relatively limited apparent errors of omission or commission compared to the CDL classifications. This is due to several factors. First, the use of multi-temporal Landsat data, as opposed to single Landsat acquisitions, that enables crop rotations and inter-annual variability in the state of the vegetation to be accommodated for and provides more opportunities for cloud-free, non-missing and atmospherically uncontaminated surface observations. Second, the adoption of an object-based approach, namely the variational region-based geometric active contour method that enables robust segmentation with only a small number of parameters and that requires no training data. Third, the use of a watershed algorithm to decompose connected segments belonging to multiple fields into coherent isolated field segments and a geometry-based algorithm to detect and associate parts of circular fields together. A preliminary validation is presented to gain quantitative insights into the field extraction accuracy and to prototype a validation protocol including new geometric measures that quantify the accuracy of individual field objects.

This paper reviews the current status of selected remote sensing algorithms for estimating LST from thermal infrared (TIR) data. A brief theoretical background of the subject is presented along with a survey of the algorithms employed for obtaining LST from space-based TIR measurements. The discussion focuses on TIR data acquired from polar-orbiting satellites because of their widespread use, global applicability and higher spatial resolution compared to geostationary satellites. The theoretical framework and methodologies used to derive the LST from the data are reviewed followed by the methodologies for validating satellite-derived LST. Directions for future research to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived LST are then suggested.},

This has required the assumption that thermal distributions across the surfaces in question can be adequately represented by a very few (usually two) temperature components. We investigate here the applicability of such simple descriptions to fumarole fields, an important class of thermal phenomena. Our surface temperature surveys, conducted at Momotombo (Nicaragua) and Vulcano (Italy), suggest that SWIR emission from the interiors of high-temperature fumarole vents far exceeds that from their surroundings. In contrast, cooling crust on active lava bodies can contribute more SWIR radiation than the small areas of exposed incandescent material that are often present. Such a distinction should be discernible in the relative response of the two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) SWIR bands, providing a basis for identification of the volcanic nature of thermal anomalies in Landsat TM or similar data, even in the absence of field observations. However, estimates of subpixel temperatures and heat flux, made from such satellite data, must be considered unreliable.},

abstract = {The Mekong River Basin is considered to be the second most species rich river basin in the world. The 795,000 km2 catchment encompasses several ecoregions, incorporating biodiverse and productive wetland systems. Eighty percent of the rapidly expanding population of the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB), made up in part by Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam, live in rural areas and are heavily reliant on wetland resources. As the populations of Cambodia and Lao PDR will double in the next 20 years, pressure on natural resources and particularly wetlands can only increase. For development planning, resource and conservation management to incorporate wetland issues, information on the distribution and character of Mekong wetlands is essential. The existing but outdated wetland maps were compiled from secondary landuse-landcover data, have limited coverage, poor thematic accuracy and no meta-data. Therefore the Mekong River Commission (MRC) undertook to produce new wetland coverage for the LMB. As resources, funding and regional capacity are limited, it was determined that the method applied should use existing facilities, be easily adaptable, and replicable locally. For the product to be useful it must be accepted by local governments and decision makers. The results must be of acceptable accuracy (>75\%) and the methodology should be relatively understandable to non-experts. In the first stage of this exercise, field survey was conducted at five pilot sites covering a range of typical wetland habitats (MRC wetland classification) to supply data for a supervised classification of Landsat ETM images from the existing MRC archive. Images were analysed using ERDAS IMAGINE and applying Maximum Likelihood Classification. Field data were reserved to apply formal accuracy assessment to the final wetland habitat maps, with resulting accuracy ranging from 77 to 94\%. The maps produced are now in use at a Provincial and National level in three countries for resource and conservation planning and management applications, including designation of a Ramsar wetland site of international importance. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the quantitative details of this mechanism are speculative, it appears able partially to stabilize earth's surface temperature against the steady increase of solar luminosity believed to have occured since the origin of the solar system.},

abstract = {The crop water stress index (CWSI), developed at the USDA-ARS U.S. Water Conservation Laboratory, Phoenix, Arizona, is a commonly used index for detection of plant stress based on the difference between foliage and air temperature. Application of CWSI at local and regional scales has been hampered by the difficulty of measuring foliage temperature of partially vegetated fields. Most hand-held, airborne, and satellite-based infrared sensors measure a composite of both the soil and plant temperatures. The concept proposed here, termed the vegetation index/temperature (VIT) trapezoid, is an attempt to combine spectral vegetation indices with composite surface temperature measurements to allow application of the CWSI theory to partially-vegetated fields without knowledge of foliage temperature. Based on this approach, a new index [water deficit index (WDI)] was introduced for evaluating evapotranspiration rates of both full-cover and partially vegetated sites. By definition, WDI is related to the ratio of actual and potential evapotranspiration; in practice, WDI can be computed using remotely sensed measurements of surface temperature and reflectance (red and near-infrared spectrum) with limited on-site meteorological data (net radiation, vapor pressure deficit, wind speed, and air temperature). Both the VIT trapezoid and WDI concepts were evaluated using 1) a simulation of a two-component (soil and vegetation) energy balance model and 2) existing data from an experiment in an alfalfa field in Phoenix, Arizona. Results from both studies showed that the WDI provided accurate estimates of field evapotranspiration rates and relative field water deficit for both full-cover and partially vegetated sites.},

abstract = { The data from the Landsat program constitutes the longest record of the Earth's surface as seen from space. Landsat 1 was launched in 1972 with the Multi-Spectral Scanner sensor (MSS), which was specifically designed for land remote sensing. This sensor proved so valuable that it was used with four subsequent Landsat missions. In 1982, Landsat 4 was launched with two sensors, MSS and a new sensor called the Thematic Mapper (TM) which had significant improvements in resolution as well as additional bands. The same payload was launched on Landsat 5 in 1984. Landsat 6 was launched in 1993 but failed to reach orbit. Landsat 7 was launched in 1999 with an improved TM sensor called the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+). The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) was launched in 2000 on the EO-1 (Earth Observer-1) satellite to test technology that will be used for the next Landsat platform, Landsat 8. In comparison to Landsat 7 ETM+, EO1 ALI provides a greater signal to noise ratio, a pushbroom sensor, greater quantization, and additional wavelength bands. As technology evolved, newer Landsat sensors were modified slightly while keeping in mind the importance of historical data continuity. There is a keen interest in documenting data continuity over the different Landsat sensors. This study attempts to quantify (within the limits of available information) data continuity over the three most recent Landsat sensors and the EO-1 ALI sensor. The data set in this analysis includes images from Landsat 4, 5, and 7 TM beginning in 1989 and images from the EO-1ALI platform acquired in 2001. All the images used were received radiometrically corrected to NASA level 1.},

abstract = {The 16-day revisit cycle of Landsat has long limited its use for studying global biophysical processes, which evolve rapidly during the growing season. In cloudy areas of the Earth, the problem is compounded, and researchers are fortunate to get two to three clear images per year. At the same time, the coarse resolution of sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) limits the sensors' ability to quantify biophysical processes in heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, the authors present a new spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) algorithm to blend Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance. Using this approach, high-frequency temporal information from MODIS and high-resolution spatial information from Landsat can be blended for applications that require high resolution in both time and space. The MODIS daily 500-m surface reflectance and the 16-day repeat cycle Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) 30-m surface reflectance are used to produce a synthetic "daily" surface reflectance product at ETM+ spatial resolution. The authors present results both with simulated (model) data and actual Landsat/MODIS acquisitions. In general, the STARFM accurately predicts surface reflectance at an effective resolution close to that of the ETM+. However, the performance depends on the characteristic patch size of the landscape and degrades somewhat when used on extremely heterogeneous fine-grained landscapes},

We address the issue of accurate force fields and determine the partial charges that can closely reproduce the experimental contact angle.

abstract = {Agrometeorological crop simulation models are used increasingly in spatial applications like regional crop monitoring and yield forecasting. The spatial application of these models involves gathering spatially representative values of meteorological input variables (temperature, radiation and precipitation). This is usually accomplished by interpolating meteorological variables measured at point locations. This paper explores the use of advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-derived surface temperature as a replacement for interpolated maximum air temperature in a spatial crop monitoring and yield forecasting system. A 2-year set of daily National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-AVHRR images over western Europe was used to derive estimates of daily surface temperature aggregated over 50 km ?? 50 km gridcells, a land cover database was used to select only pixels that were classified as 'arable land'. On days that did not yield data due to cloud cover, the monthly average surface temperature was substituted. The AVHRR-derived surface temperature is usually higher than the maximum air temperature measured at a weather station. To account for this difference, an empirical model was used that relates surface temperature to maximum air temperature. The model parameters were obtained using calibration with the maximum air temperature measured at five weather stations. Next, it was applied to the entire AVHRR data set in order to convert AVHRR surface temperature into a simulated maximum air temperature. Finally, a case study was carried out by using the WOrld FOod Studies (WOFOST) crop model to simulate growth of winter-wheat and sunflower for Spain using both the simulated maximum air temperature and the interpolated maximum air temperature from weather stations. Our results demonstrate that the spatial patterns of the yearly temperature sums over Spain are similar for both sources of temperature. Therefore, it can be concluded that the AVHRR-derived temperature can be used to obtain realistic spatial patterns of the yearly temperature sums. Nevertheless, the AVHRR-derived temperature sums are too large, particularly in the southern parts of Spain. As the model that was applied to correct for the difference between surface temperature and maximum air temperature does not fully correct for this difference in the southern parts of Spain. The effects on the simulation of winter-wheat and sunflower are predictable. For both crops the overestimation of the temperature sums causes a shortening of the growing season and consequently a lower accumulation of biomass at the end of the season. This effect is more pronounced for sunflower because this crop is grown later in the crop growing season.It was demonstrated that AVHRR-derived surface temperature has good potential for use in regional agrometeorological systems but more attention should be paid to the correction of AVHRR-derived surface temperature to maximum air temperature. For example, by applying the correction for the different climatic regions instead of one correction for the entire study area. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Visible near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has long been used for geothermal exploration. Specific focus on the TIR region (8-12. $\mu$m) has resulted in major-rock-forming mineral classes being identified and their areal percentages to be more easily mapped due in part to the linear mixing behavior of TIR emission. To understand the mineral compositional and thermal distribution of active geothermal surfaces systems, hyperspectral TIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) airborne sensor were acquired over the Salton Sea, CA geothermal fields by The Aerospace Corporation on March 26, 2009 and April 6, 2010. SEBASS collects 128 wavelength channels at \~{}. 1. m spatial resolution. Such high resolution data are rarely available for this type of scientific analysis and enabled the identification of rare mineral assemblages associated with the geothermally-active areas. One surface unit with a unique spectrum, believed to be a magnesium sulfate of unknown hydration state, was identified for the first time in the SEBASS data. The abundance and distribution of this mineral varied between 2009 and 2010 likely due to the precipitation conditions. Data obtained by the SEBASS sensor were also regressed to the 32 channel spectral resolution of the Mineral and Gas Identifier (MAGI) airborne sensor in order to test sensitivity limits. At this lower spectral resolution, all surface minerals were still effectively identified and therefore validated data at MAGI resolution are still very effective for accurate surface compositional mapping. A similar approach used at active geothermal areas in other semi-arid regions around the world has the potential to better characterize transient mineralogy, identify "indicators minerals", understand the influence of surface and ground water, and ultimately to locate new geothermal targets for future exploration. Furthermore, new Mineral and Gas Identification (MAGI) data serve as an excellent precursor for future spaceborne TIR data such as the system proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) instrument. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This resumed activity coincides with similar outbreaks in the Philippines and Japan, which are located in an identical tectonic environment. This study addresses (1) remote sensing temporal monitoring of the volcanic activity, (2) detecting hot lava and measuring its pixel-integrated and sub-pixel temperatures, and (3) the importance of SWIR bands for high temperature volcanic feature detection. Seven sets of TM data acquired continuously from 3 March 1991 to 8 July 1991 have been analyzed. ft is concluded that detectable pre-eruption warming took place around 25 March 1991 and volcanic activity started on 1 April 1991. It is observed that high temperature features such as an erupting volcano can register emitted thermal radiance in SWIR bands. Calculation of pixel-integrated and sub-pixel temperatures related to volcanic vents has been made, using the dual-band method.},

abstract = {We analyze surface air temperature data from available meteorological stations with principal focus on the period 1880-1985. The temperature changes at mid- and high latitude stations separated by less than 1000 km are shown to be highly correlated; at low latitudes the correlation falls off more rapidly with distance for nearby stations. We combine the station data in a way which is designed to provide accurate long-term variations. Error estimates are based in part on studies of how accurately the actual station distributions are able to reproduce temperature change in a global data set produced by a three- dimensional general circulation model with realistic variability. We find that meaningful global temperature change can be obtained for the past century, despite the fact that the meteorological stations are confined mainly to continental and island locations. The results indicate a global warming of about 0.5\o-0.7\o C in the past century, with warming of similar magnitude in both hemispheres; the northern hemisphere result is similar to that found by several other investigators. A strong warming trend between 1965 and 1980 raised the global mean temperature in 1980 and 1981 to the highest level in the period of instrumental records. The warm period in recent years differs qualitatively from the earlier warm period centered about 1940; the earlier warming was focused at high northern latitudes, while the recent warnting is more global. We present selected graphs and maps of the temperature change in each of the eight latitude zones. A computer tape of the derived regional and global temperature changes is available from the authors.},

Records from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and (Advanced) Along Track Scanning Radiometer ((A)ATSR) are providing long-term time series information. Assessing the quality of remote sensing-based temperature measurements provides feedback to the climate modeling community and other users by identifying agreements and discrepancies when compared to temperature records from meteorological stations. This paper presents a comparison of state-of-the-art remote sensing-based land surface temperature data with air temperature measurements from meteorological stations on a pan-arctic scale (north of 60° latitude). Within this study, we compared land surface temperature products from (A)ATSR, MODIS and AVHRR with an in situ air temperature (Tair) database provided by the National Climate Data Center (NCDC). Despite analyzing the whole acquisition time period of each land surface temperature product, we focused on the inter-annual variability comparing land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature for the overlapping time period of the remote sensing data (2000–2005). In addition, land cover information was included in the evaluation approach by using GLC2000. MODIS has been identified as having the highest agreement in comparison to air temperature},

The method is applied to compute the temperature dependencies of gamma and tau for the (110) Cu surface using Monte Carlo simulations with an embedded-atom potential. Both quantities decrease with temperature but remain different even near the bulk melting point despite extensive premelting of this surface. This difference is explained by the existence in the premelted surface structure of a solid-liquid interface with relatively small but finite values of gamma and tau. Separate calculations of the (110) solid-liquid interface stress give a negative value, suggesting that this interface is in a state of compression. This study motivates future work on anisotropy of surface/interface free energies and stresses, and on the extension of this method to more complex systems.},

abstract = {Climate records of the past 140 years are examined for the impact of major volcanic eruptions on surface temperature. After the low-frequency variations and El Nino/Southern Oscillation signal are removed, it is shown that for 2 years following great volcanic eruptions, the surface cools significantly by 0.1-0.2°C in the global mean, in each hemisphere, and in the summer in the latitude bands 0°-30°S and 0°-30°N and by 0.3°C in the summer in the lattiude band 30°-60°N. By contrast, in the first winter after major tropical eruptions and in the second winter after major hihg-latitude eruptions, North America and Eurasia warm by serveral degrees, while northern Africa and southwestern Asia cool by more than 0.5°C. Becuase several large eruptions occurred at the same time as ENSO events, the warming produced by the ENSO masked the volcanic cooling during the first year after the eruptions. The timescale of the ENSO response is only 1 year while the volcanic timescale is 2 years, so the cooling in the second year is evident whether the ENSO signal is removed or not. These results, both the global cooling and Northern Hemisphere continental winter warming, agree with general circulation model calculations.},

Two of the SST reconstructions exhibit statistically significant cooling trends over the eastern equatorial Pacific, in disagreement with the un‐interpolated SST and marine air temperature datasets which show statistically significant warming in this region.

Crystal truncation rod profiles in the 00L, 10L, and 20L directions have been recorded on [001]-oriented single crystals at both room temperature and approximately 670 K under UHV conditions. Modeling of these data has enabled a detailed picture of the surface structure at both room and high temperature to be determined. At room temperature the surface is found to be terminated by aluminum, and a fairly minor structural rearrangement relative to the ideally terminated surface is found to occur, involving a relaxation of the surface oxygen atoms away from the surface and a small relaxation of the aluminum atoms into the surface. At the higher temperature a much more significant and reversible structural transformation occurs involving the top four atomic surface layers. This is primarily characterized by a substantial vertical movement of the top surface oxygen atoms and a concomitant relaxation of the aluminum atom into the surface, together with appreciable lateral movements of the oxygen atoms in the top two layers. The lanthanum and oxygen atoms in the third and fourth atomic layers also show clearly discernible movements.},

The coarser resolution vegetation index data is first fused with finer resolution data to obtain time series finer resolution data. Temporal features are extracted from the fused data and added to improve classification accuracy. The result indicates that temporal features extracted from coarser resolution data have significant effect on improving classification accuracy of finer resolution data, especially for vegetation types. The overall classification accuracy is significantly improved approximately 4\% from 90.4\% to 94.6\% and 89.0\% to 93.7\% for using Landsat 8 and Landsat 5 data, respectively.

abstract = {Regional climate change induced by rapid urbanization is responsible for and may result from changes in coupled human-ecological systems. Specifically, the distribution of urban vegetation may be an important intermediary between patterns of human settlement and regional climate spatial variability. To test this hypothesis we identified the relationships between surface temperature, one component of regional climate, vegetation, and human settlement patterns in the Phoenix, AZ, USA region. Combining satellite-derived surface temperature and vegetation data from an early summer day with US Census and topographic data, we found substantial surface temperature differences within the city that correlate primarily with an index of vegetation cover. Furthermore, both of these patterns vary systematically with the social characteristics of neighborhoods through the region. Overall, every \$10,000 increase in neighborhood annual median household income was associated with a 0.28°C decrease in surface temperature on an early summer day in Phoenix. Temperature variation within a neighborhood was negatively related to population density. A multivariate model generated using path analysis supports our hypothesis that social impacts on surface temperature occur primarily through modifications of vegetation cover. Higher income neighborhoods were associated with increased vegetation cover and higher density neighborhoods were associated with decreased vegetation variability. These results suggest that settlement patterns in the central Arizona region influence regional climate through multiple pathways that are heterogeneously distributed throughout the city.},

abstract = {The annual cycle in the Earth's surface temperature is extremely large-comparable in magnitude to the glacial-interglacial cycles over most of the planet. Trends in the phase and the amplitude of the annual cycle have been observed, but the causes and significance of these changes remain poorly understood-in part because we lack an understanding of the natural variability. Here we show that the phase of the annual cycle of surface temperature over extratropical land shifted towards earlier seasons by 1.7 days between 1954 and 2007; this change is highly anomalous with respect to earlier variations, which we interpret as being indicative of the natural range. Significant changes in the amplitude of the annual cycle are also observed between 1954 and 2007. These shifts in the annual cycles appear to be related, in part, to changes in the northern annular mode of climate variability, although the land phase shift is significantly larger than that predicted by trends in the northern annular mode alone. Few of the climate models presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reproduce the observed decrease in amplitude and none reproduce the shift towards earlier seasons.},

The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR’s near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1° OI analyses.

The index is related to soil moisture and, in comparison to existing interpretations of the Ts/NDVI space, the index is conceptually and computationally straightforward. It is based on satellite derived information only, and the potential for operational application of the index is therefore large. The spatial pattern and temporal evolution in TVDI has been analysed using 37 NOAA-AVHRR images from 1990 covering part of the Ferlo region of northern, semiarid Senegal in West Africa. The spatial pattern in TVDI has been compared with simulations of soil moisture from a distributed hydrological model based on the MIKE SHE code.

abstract = {Satellite imagery is the major data source for regional to global land cover maps. However, land cover mapping of large areas with medium-resolution imagery is costly and often constrained by the lack of good training and validation data. Our goal was to overcome these limitations, and to test chain classifications, i.e., the classification of Landsat images based on the information in the overlapping areas of neighboring scenes. The basic idea was to classify one Landsat scene first where good ground truth data is available, and then to classify the neighboring Landsat scene using the land cover classification of the first scene in the overlap area as training data. We tested chain classification for a forest/non-forest classification in the Carpathian Mountains on one horizontal chain of six Landsat scenes, and two vertical chains of two Landsat scenes each. We collected extensive training data from Quickbird imagery for classifying radiometrically uncorrected data with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVMs classified 8 scenes with overall accuracies between 92.1\% and 98.9\% (average of 96.3\%). Accuracy loss when automatically classifying neighboring scenes with chain classification was 1.9\% on average. Even a chain of six images resulted only in an accuracy loss of 5.1\% for the last image compared to a reference classification from independent training data for the last image. Chain classification thus performed well, but we note that chain classification can only be applied when land cover classes are well represented in the overlap area of neighboring Landsat scenes. As long as this constraint is met though, chain classification is a powerful approach for large area land cover classifications, especially in areas of varying training data availability. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The accurate imaging of geothermal systems from the ground surface down to great depths is an interdisciplinary problem common to geothermal resource exploration and development. Rocks can be characterized mainly in terms of their lithology, mineralogy, fracture distribution, permeability, thermal conductivity and porosity, and similarly the geothermal fluid (and its circulation) by its geochemistry, flow pattern, velocity, temperature and pressure. Some of these data are obtained by well logging and from laboratory tests conducted on drillhole cores. In general, the distribution of geothermal wells is not random, and well data are limited in terms of quantity and depth range. Accordingly, a sophisticated spatial modeling technique is indispensable in the three-dimensional imaging of geothermal systems. We describe a versatile 3-D modeling method that can be used to determine the temperature, flow velocity, and distribution of geological units within a geothermal field based on well log data. The model results for the Hohi geothermal area, Japan, provide plausible estimates of temperature, flow velocity, and geology to a depth of 3000 m. Superimposition of the three spatial models we obtained shows that, at Hohi, two geothermal reservoirs are localized near highly fractured fault zones that provide paths for the ascent of thermal fluids from depth. ?? 2007 CNR.},

A total of 12 separate regions were found to have consistent temperature patterns associated with low phase of the SO, while 11 areas were found to have temperature patterns associated with the high phase. Of these areas, 9 have expected temperature patterns during both phases of the SO. In the tropics, temperature anomalies are of the same sign as the SO-related sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in all land regions except for one area in the west Pacific. Three extratropical responses to the low phase of the SO are found over North America and one is found in Japan. High SO-temperature patterns were found in the extratropies for Japan, western Europe, and northwestern North America.

abstract = {The following paper presents a method to retrieve surface reflectance, emissivity and temperature in the middle infrared (3-5 $\mu$m) and thermal infrared (8-12 $\upsilon$m). It is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired over Southern Africa during the August to October 2000 period. This method relies first on atmospheric correction of the middle-thermal infrared radiances which uses National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) humidity, pressure and temperature profiles and second on constructing and using a database of night emissivities ratio (Temperature Independent Spectral Indices of Emissivity, TISIE). The middle infrared reflectances (3-5 $\mu$m) are then derived from day-time measurements and mean TISIE values. By hemispheric integration (over a 16-day period), they lead to middle infrared directional emissivity which, combined with TISIE again, leads to thermal infrared emissivity and surface temperature. The reflectance accuracies are assessed by looking at targets of known reflectance (water and sun-glint). The emissivities in the thermal infrared are assessed by checking the spectral invariance of the derived surface temperature in the 3-5- and 8-12-$\mu$m region. Other consistency checks are performed leading to the conclusion that the reflectance, emissivity and surface temperature are derived within ± 0.015, ± 0.01 and ± 1 K, respectively. Finally, a direct application of the MODIS middle infrared surface reflectances to the fire detection problem is developed and the results compared to the Landsat 7 high spatial resolution data. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Recent significant improvements in the wavelength coverage, spectral resolution and quality of remote sensing imagery have led to the extensive application of these data sets in exploration and site characterization. Traditional techniques in spectral and spatial analysis of imagery, coupled with new, high signal to noise data, allow their direct application to problems in geothermal energy exploration and develop- ment. Our work seeks to define surface indicators of geothermal resources at known source regions and to apply these tools to recognizing geothermal potential in other areas. Geothermal indicators include sinter, tufa (carbonate), hydrothermal alter- ation (clays, sulfates) and thermal anomalies. Our work responds to the need to iden- tify new resources and to map the geology of these areas. In addition, we hope to bring down costs by helping to focus new development in existing resource areas. Our work demonstrates that airborne and spaceborne imagery can be used to map mineralogy and hot spots over broad and inaccessible regions. We have clearly associated indica- tor mineralogy with present and past geothermal activity. Remote sensing data have been able to identify fault extensions not previously mapped by field geologists. Future work will test these methods on new sites not yet producing power to confirm their predictive capabilities for new resources.},

abstract = {We report an estimate of the Earth’s average land surface temperature for the period 1753 to 2011. To address issues of potential station selection bias, we used a larger sampling of stations than had prior studies. For the period post 1880, our estimate is similar to those previously reported by other groups, although we report smaller uncertainties. The land temperature rise from the 1950s decade to the 2000s decade is 0.90 ± 0.05°C (95\% confidence). Both maximum and minimum daily temperatures have increased during the last century. Diurnal variations decreased from 1900 to 1987, and then increased; this increase is significant but not understood. The period of 1753 to 1850 is marked by sudden drops in land surface temperature that are coincident with known volcanism; the response function is approximately 1.5 ± 0.5°C per 100 Tg of atmospheric sulfate. This volcanism, combined with a simple proxy for anthropogenic effects (logarithm of the CO2 concentration), reproduces much of the variation in the land surface temperature record; the fit is not improved by the addition of a solar forcing term. Thus, for this very simple model, solar forcing does not appear to contribute to the observed global warming of the past 250 years; the entire change can be modeled by a sum of volcanism and a single anthropogenic proxy. The residual variations include interannual and multi-decadal variability very similar to that of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)},

By decomposing recent observed surface temperatures into components associated with ENSO, volcanic and solar activity, and anthropogenic influences, we anticipate global and regional changes in the next two decades. From 2009 to 2014, projected rises in anthropogenic influences and solar irradiance will increase global surface temperature 0.15 0.03C, at a rate 50\% greater than predicted by IPCC. But as a result of declining solar activity in the subsequent five years, average temperature in 2019 is only 0.03 0.01C warmer than in 2014. This lack of overall warming is analogous to the period from 2002 to 2008 when decreasing solar irradiance also countered much of the anthropogenic warming.

abstract = {The estimation of near surface air temperature (Ta) is useful for a wide range of applications such as agriculture, climate related diseases and climate change studies. Air temperature is commonly obtained from synoptic measurements in weather stations. In Africa, the spatial distribution of weather stations is often limited and the dissemination of temperature data is variable, therefore limiting their use for real-time applications. Compensation for this paucity of information may be obtained by using satellite-based methods. However, the derivation of near surface air temperature (Ta), from the land surface temperature (Ts) derived from satellite is far from straight forward. Some studies have tried to derive maximum Ta from satellites through regression analysis but the accuracy obtained is quite variable according to the study. The main objective of this study was to explore the possibility of retrieving high-resolution Ta data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Ts products over different ecosystems in Africa. First, comparisons between night MODIS Ts data with minimum Ta showed that MODIS nighttime products provide a good estimation of minimum Ta over different ecosystems (with (??Ts - Ta) centered at 0 ??C, a mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.73 ??C and a standard deviation = 2.4 ??C). Secondly, comparisons between day MODIS Ts data with maximum Ta showed that (??Ts - Ta) strongly varies according to the seasonality, the ecosystems, the solar radiation, and cloud-cover. Two factors proposed in the literature to retrieve maximum Ta from Ts, i.e. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA), were analyzed. No strong relationship between (??Ts - Ta) and (i) NDVI and (ii) SZA was observed, therefore requiring further research on robust methods to retrieve maximum Ta. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The Wenchuan (汶川) earthquake triggered cascading disasters of landslides and debris flows that caused severe vegetation damage. Fracture zones can affect geodynamics and spatial pattern of vegetation damage. A segment tracing algorithm method was applied for identifying the regional fracture system through lineament extractions from a shaded digital elevation model with 25 m mesh for southern Wenchuan. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were used to analyze the spatiotemporal vegetation pattern. The relationship between vegetation type identified from satellite images and lineament density was used to characterize the distribution patterns of each vegetation type according to fracture zones. Broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, and farmland persist in areas with moderate lineament density. Deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forest persists in less fractured areas. Shrub and meadow seem to be relatively evenly distributed across all lineament densities. Meadow, farmland, and shrub persist in the fractured areas. Changes of spatial structure and correlation between vegetation patterns before and after the earthquake were examined using semivariogram analysis of normalized difference vegetation indices derived from Landsat enhanced thematic mapper images. The sill values of the semivariograms show that the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation covers increased after the earthquake. Moreover, the anisotropic behaviors of the semivariograms coincide with the vegetation changes due to the strikes of fracture zones.},

abstract = {The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Alaska Energy Author- ity are jointly funding a project to re-assess the resource potential of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. Phase one of this project has included airborne thermal infrared remote sensing for mapping surface geothermal phenomena and assess- ment of the resource potential of the system. Thermal infrared and optical images were acquired over the Pilgrim Hot Springs site and neighboring regions during two surveys in fall 2010 and spring 2011. Thermal images providing information on land surface temperature at a spatial resolution better than 1.3 meters were acquired using a FLIR A320 camera operating in the broad 7.5−13 µm wavelength region. Fieldwork during the airborne surveys gathered ground calibration and validation data such as hot spring, ground, and at- mospheric temperatures, atmospheric humidity and the precise GPS locations of low-emissivity ground targets. We applied atmospheric correction, registration and mosaicking to generate seamless maps of calibrated surface temperature across the study area. Analysis of this data enables delineation of the main geothermal features of the system including hot springs, pools, and areas of thermally anomalous ground. Using a thermal-budget approach the thermal heat flux sustaining surface geothermal waters was estimated from the fall and spring FLIR data. Calculated heat fluxes and outflow rates assuming a hot spring temperature of 81°C is significantly higher than previous field-based methods. Our work demonstrates that airborne thermal infrared remote sensing provides a rapid and relatively low cost method for mapping and quantitative assessment of undeveloped spring-dominated geothermal systems in Alaska},

abstract = {An efficient time-dependent equation for predicting ground surface temperature devised by Bhumralkar (1975) and Blackadar (1976) is tested against a 12-layer soil model and compared with five other approximate methods in current use. It is found to be generally superior if diurnal forcing is present and very much superior to the use of the insulated surface assumption. An analogous method of predicting ground surface moisture content is presented which allows the surface to become moist quickly during rainfall or to become drier than the bulk soil while evaporation occurs. These improved methods are not of much relevance unless the main influences of a vegetation layer are included. An efficient one-layer foliage parameterization is therefore developed that extends continuously from the case of no shielding of the ground by vegetation to complete shielding. It includes influences of both ground and foliage albedos and emissivlties, net leaf area index, stomatal resistance, retained water on the foliage, and several other considerations. When it is tested against data for wheat measured by Penman and Long (1960), it appears quite adequate despite the many simplifying assumptions. The parameterization predicts that errors of up to a factor of 2 in evapotranspiration can be incurred by ignoring the presence of a vegetation layer.},

abstract = {Current satellite sensors provide data of insufficient spatial and temporal resolutions to fully characterize the patchy phenology patterns of dryland forests. The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is an algorithm that fuses Landsat 30. m data with MODIS 500. m data to produce synthetic imagery at Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS time steps. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using STARFM to produce synthetic imagery over a dryland vegetation study site for the purpose of tracking phenological changes. We assembled subsets of six Landsat-5 TM scenes and temporally-coincident MODIS datasets spanning the 2006 April-October growing season in central-northern Arizona, which is characterized by large tracts of dryland forest. To investigate the effects of temporal compositing, BRDF-adjustment, and base pair timing on the accuracy of the resulting synthetic imagery, we employed a range of MODIS 500. m surface reflectance datasets (daily, 8-day composite, and 16-day Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR)) as well as initial Landsat/MODIS imagery pairs from opposite ends of the growing season. The STARFM algorithm was applied to each MODIS data series to produce up to twelve synthetic images corresponding to each Landsat image. We evaluated the accuracy of the synthetic images by comparing the reflectance values of a random sample of the vegetation pixels with the corresponding pixel values of the reference Landsat image on a band-by-band basis. Our results indicate that the NBAR imagery is the optimal dataset for use with Landsat-5 TM data in this area. The NBAR dataset consistently returned the lowest absolute difference values and the highest correlations. A comparison of landscape-scale maps of the timing and value of the peak NDVI derived from STARFM, Landsat, and MODIS (NBAR) time series across the full 2006 growing season shows the effect of the heightened spatial and temporal resolution offered by a STARFM-based dataset. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using the STARFM algorithm to assemble an imagery time series at Landsat spatial resolution and MODIS temporal resolution in vegetated dryland ecosystems. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Measurement of the SPR-mediated photothermal local heating of the substrate surface by a molecular thermometry strategy indicated the temperature to be above 230 °C, which led to an efficient decomposition of CH(3)AuPPh(3) to form Au nanoparticles on the Ag surface. Particle sizes were tunable between 3 and 10 nm by adjusting the deposition time. A surface-limited growth model for Au nanoparticles on Ag is consistent with the deposition kinetics.},

abstract = {Alumina is a technologically important oxide crystal because of its use as a catalyst and as a substrate for microelectronic applications. A precise knowledge of its surface atomic structure is a prerequisite for understanding and controlling the physical processes involved in many of its applications. Here we use a dynamic scanning force microscopy technique to image directly the atomic structure of the high-temperature phase of the alpha-Al2O3(0001) surface. Evidence for a surface reconstruction appears as a grid of protrusions that represent a rhombic unit cell, and we confirm that the arrangement of atoms is in the form of surface domains with hexagonal atomic order at the centre and disorder at the periphery. We show that, on exposing the surface to water and hydrogen, this surface structure is important in the formation of hydroxide clusters. These clusters appear as a regular pattern of rings that can be explained by self-organization processes involving cluster-surface and cluster-cluster interactions. Alumina has long been regarded as the definitive test for atomic-resolution force microscopy of insulators so the whole class of insulating oxides should now open for direct atomic-scale surface investigations.},

Using a century of surface marine observations it is shown that middle- and high-latitude sea surface temperature (SST) display a long-term fluctuation with negative anomalies before 1920, and during the 1970s and 1980s. Positive SST conditions prevailed from about 1930 to 1960. The pattern of interdecadal SST variability is constructed by subtracting the average field during 15 cold years from that during a similar interval of warm years. The early-century warming and the more recent cooling display a similar spatial pattern. In both cases the pattern is basin scale and largely of one polarity, with maxima in the vicinity of Iceland, in the Labrador Sea, and northeast of Bermuda. The corresponding differences in surface atmospheric conditions are determined by averaging and subtracting, in the same manner, fields of sea level pressure (SLP) and surf...},

abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25–30°C per kilometer depth, however in active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150°C per kilometer depth can be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hot water is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles are evidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling and drying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper we review the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from the traditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirect detection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat fluxes, geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to published remote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions, mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from the La Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between various surface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute to exploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached full maturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework. A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and the present contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number of question lines: ‘how reproducible are remote sensing products’, ‘can long term monitoring of geothermal systems be achieved’ and ‘do surface manifestations link to subsurface features’?},

High-resolution models suggest that the related sea surface temperature threshold for tropical cyclones rises in a warming climate5,6. Some observations for the past fewdecades, however, showthat tropical tropospheric warming has been nearly uniform vertically7,8, suggesting that the troposphere may have become less stable and casting doubts on the possibility that the sea surface temperature threshold increases substantially with global warming. Here we turn to satellite observations of rainfall for the past 30 years. We detect significant covariability between tropical mean sea surface temperatures and the convective threshold on interannual and longer timescales. In addition, we find a parallel upward trend of approximately 0.1 ◦C/decade over the past 30 years in both the convective threshold and tropical mean sea surface temperatures. We conclude that, in contrast with some observational indications, the tropical troposphere has warmed in a way that is consistent with moist-adiabatic adjustment, in agreement with global climate model simulations.},

abstract = {Volcanoes are amongst the few geological landforms which undergo changes at scales and rates sufficient to warrant frequent surveillance. Monitoring of volcanoes is important for documenting their course of activity in order to understand their behavior. Monitoring is therefore an essential precursor step before the goals of predicting eruptions and their related hazards can be achieved. Modern remote sensing techniques provide the only means whereby any volcano in the world can be studied. In many cases, remote sensing observations provide the only available data on the activity of an individual volcano; in other cases they may support and refine field observations. Here I report the results of studies by my colleagues and I on the applications of the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and other satellite systems to the identification and monitoring of active volcanoes. Three different applications will be briefly discussed: (1) identifying active volcanoes; (2) spectral studies; and (3) thermal monitoring of volcanoes. The Landsat Thematic Mapper is in sun-synchronous orbit around the Earth at an altitude of 705 km, such that it passes overhead any given volcano once every 16 days. It is equipped with seven sensors, four operating in the visible and near infrared (0.45-0.90 [mu]m); two in the short wavelength infrared (1.55-1.75 and 2.08-2.35 [mu]m) and one in the thermal infrared (10.4-12.8 [mu]m). It images a swath 185 km wide with a pixel size of 30 m (120 m in the thermal infrared band). The French SPOT system images a 65 km wide swath with a pixel size of 20 m in each of four multispectral bands (visible and near infrared) but also offers panchromatic data with a pixel size of 10 m, and the ability to provide stereoscopic views.},

abstract = {As of writing in mid-2010, both Landsat-5 and -7 continue to function, with sufficient fuel to enable data collection until the launch of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) scheduled for December of 2012. Failure of one or both of Landsat-5 or -7 may result in a lack of Landsat data for a period of time until the 2012 launch. Although the potential risk of a component failure increases the longer the sensor's design life is exceeded, the possible gap in Landsat data acquisition is reduced with each passing day and the risk of Landsat imagery being unavailable diminishes for all except a handful of applications that are particularly data demanding. Advances in Landsat data compositing and fusion are providing opportunities to address issues associated with Landsat-7 SLC-off imagery and to mitigate a potential acquisition gap through the integration of imagery from different sensors. The latter will likely also provide short-term, regional solutions to application-specific needs for the continuity of Landsat-like observations. Our goal in this communication is not to minimize the community's concerns regarding a gap in Landsat observations, but rather to clarify how the current situation has evolved and provide an up-to-date understanding of the circumstances, implications, and mitigation options related to a potential gap in the Landsat data record. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Landsat 8, a NASA and USGS collaboration, acquires global moderate-resolution measurements of the Earth's terrestrial and polar regions in the visible, near-infrared, short wave, and thermal infrared. Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40. year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {Burn scar extraction using remote sensing data is an efficient way to precisely evaluate burn area and measure vegetation recovery. Traditional burn scar extraction methodologies have no well effect on burn scar image with blurred and irregular edges. To address these issues, this paper proposes an automatic method to extract burn scar based on Level Set Method (LSM). This method utilizes the advantages of the different features in remote sensing images, as well as considers the practical needs of extracting the burn scar rapidly and automatically. This approach integrates Change Vector Analysis (CVA), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) to obtain difference image and modifies conventional Level Set Method Chan-Vese (C-V) model with a new initial curve which results from a binary image applying K-means method on fitting errors of two near-infrared band images. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI data sets are used to validate the proposed method. Comparison with conventional C-V model, OSTU algorithm, Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) algorithm are made to show that the proposed approach can extract the outline curve of fire burn scar effectively and exactly. The method has higher extraction accuracy and less algorithm complexity than that of the conventional C-V model.},

abstract = {Mud volcanoes are relatively small spatter cones that erupt water-laden mud and gases, and occur throughout the world. For many mud volcanoes, the eruption of warm mud (10-40°C) can be detected with high-resolution thermal satellite imagery. We demonstrate the utility of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery for thermal monitoring of active mud volcanism. We constrain the temperature and area of active mud discharge and estimate surface heat flux for two isolated mud volcanoes in the Copper River Basin, Alaska using Band 6 (10.4-12.5 $\mu$m). The heat flux results span a wide range due to uncertainties in the environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition, but can be constrained to be less than 0.24 MW for each of the two mud volcanoes considering previously published field measurements. With this higher-resolution Band 6 on the ETM+ sensor, as well as the high-resolution thermal bands on the ASTER sensor, reliable monitoring of mud volcanism on this scale is possible for the first time. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Many neuroscientists access surface brain structures via a small cranial window, opened in the bone above the brain region of interest. Unfortunately this methodology has the potential to perturb the structure and function of the underlying brain tissue. One potential perturbation is heat loss from the brain surface, which may result in local dysregulation of brain temperature. Here, we demonstrate that heat loss is a significant problem in a cranial window preparation in common use for electrical recording and imaging studies in mice. In the absence of corrective measures, the exposed surface of the neocortex was at ∼28°C, ∼10°C below core body temperature, and a standing temperature gradient existed, with tissue below the core temperature even several millimeters into the brain. Cooling affected cellular and network function in neocortex and resulted principally from increased heat loss due to convection and radiation through the skull and cranial window. We demonstrate that constant perfusion of solution, warmed to 37°C, over the brain surface readily corrects the brain temperature, resulting in a stable temperature of 36-38°C at all depths. Our results indicate that temperature dysregulation may be common in cranial window preparations that are in widespread use in neuroscience, underlining the need to take measures to maintain the brain temperature in many physiology experiments.},

abstract = {The Indian Peninsula in general and its southern part in particular has been thought to be a stable shield area and hence inert to younger earth movements and seismicities. However, in addition to fast relapsing seismicities, the studies carried out by earlier workers during the past three decades indicate possible pulsatory tectonism, at least since the Jurassics. The present study is a newer attempt to identify, analyse, and spatially amalgamate a large number of anomalies visibly displayed by the tectonic, fluvial, coastal, and hydrological systems in remote sensing and ground based datasets/observations, and to finally paint a fair picture on the active tectonic scenario of South India. The study reveals that the phenomena, viz. extensive soil erosion, reservoir siltation, sediment dump into the ocean, preferential migration of rivers, restricted marine regression, shrinkage of back waters, withdrawal of creeks, fall of groundwater table, etc., indicate two E-W trending ongoing tectonic (Cymatogenic) archings along Mangalore-Chennai in the north and Cochin-Ramanathapuram in the south. Intervening these two arches, a cymatogenic deep along Ponnani-Palghat-Manamelkudi exhibiting phenomena opposite to the above is observed. In addition, the characteristic tectonic, geomorphic, and hydrological anomalies observed in 1B satellite FCC data, as well as in the field, indicate N-S trending extensional, NE-SW sinistral, and NW - SE dextral strike slip faults. These anomalies and the tectonic features deduced thereupon, indicate that the southern part of the Indian Peninsula is tectonically active due to the northerly to north-northeasterly directed compressive force related to post collision tectonics. This active tectonic model visualized for South India gives a further clue that the whole Indian plate is whirling like a worm with alternate E-W arching and deepening, along with block and transform faulting from Cape Comorin in the south to the Himalayas in},

Satellite-observed night lights are used to identify measurement stations located in extreme darkness and adjust temperature trends of urban and periurban stations for nonclimatic factors, verifying that urban effects on analyzed global change are small. Because the GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are limited. We use simple 12 month (and n × 12) running means to improve the information content in our temperature graphs. Contrary to a popular misconception, the rate of warming has not declined. Global temperature is rising as fast in the past decade as in the prior 2 decades, despite year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Ni\~{n}o-La Ni\~{n}a cycle of tropical ocean temperature. Record high global 12 month running mean temperature for the period with instrumental data was reached in 2010.},

abstract = {The potential of Landsat data processing to provide systematic continental scale products has been demonstrated by several projects including the NASA Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The recent free availability of Landsat data increases the need for robust and efficient atmospheric correction algorithms applicable to large volume Landsat data sets. This paper compares the accuracy of two Landsat atmospheric correction methods: a MODIS-based method and the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) method. Both methods are based on the 6SV radiative transfer code but have different atmospheric characterization approaches. The MODIS-based method uses the MODIS Terra derived dynamic aerosol type, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor to atmospherically correct ETM+ acquisitions in each coincident orbit. The LEDAPS method uses aerosol characterizations derived independently from each Landsat acquisition and assumes a fixed continental aerosol type and uses ancillary water vapor. Validation results are presented comparing ETM+ atmospherically corrected data generated using these two methods with AERONET corrected ETM+ data for 95 10. km. ??. 10. km 30. m subsets, a total of nearly 8 million 30. m pixels, located across the conterminous United States. The results indicate that the MODIS-based method has better accuracy than the LEDAPS method for the ETM+ red and longer wavelength bands. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The increase of temperature leads to appreciable red shift and broadening of the surface plasmon resonance in Au nanoparticles. The obtained dependences were analyzed within the framework of theoretical model considering the thermal expansion of the nanoparticle, the electron–phonon scattering in the nanoparticle and the temperature dependence of dielectric permittivity of the host matrix. The thermal expansion was shown to be the main mechanism responsible for the temperature induced red shift of the surface plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles. The thermal volume expansion coefficient for Au nanoparticles was found to be size-independent in the studied size range. Meanwhile, the increase of electron–phonon scattering rate with increasing temperature was shown to be the dominant mechanism of the surface plasmon resonance broadening in the gold nanoparticles.},

Bears did not arouse from torpor throughout the winter test period. Abdominal temperature remained within a 1.5degreesC temperature range and did not appear to exhibit circadian rhythmicity. However, neck surface temperature of bears demonstrated elevated spikes from 2 to 30degreesC about 4 times each day. Adult students wearing the same neck sensors as bears exhibited similar spikes in body surface temperature when vigorously exercising in the cold. We suggest that bears engage in bouts of muscle activity during the winter denning period that may result in the retention of muscle strength without elevating their core body temperature and without arousing from torpor},

abstract = {Aquifers used for the production of drinking water are increasingly being used for the generation of shallow geothermal energy. This causes temperature perturbations far beyond the natural variations in aquifers and the effects of these temperature variations on groundwater quality, in particular trace elements, have not been investigated. Here, we report the results of column experiments to assess the impacts of temperature variations (5°C, 11°C, 25°C and 60°C) on groundwater quality in anoxic reactive unconsolidated sandy sediments derived from an aquifer system widely used for drinking water production in the Netherlands. Our results showed that at 5 °C no effects on water quality were observed compared to the reference of 11°C (in situ temperature). At 25°C, As concentrations were significantly increased and at 60 °C, significant increases were observed pH and DOC, P, K, Si, As, Mo, V, B, and F concentrations. These elements should therefore be considered for water quality monitoring programs of shallow geothermal energy projects. No consistent temperature effects were observed on Na, Ca, Mg, Sr, Fe, Mn, Al, Ba, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Eu, Ho, Sb, Sc, Yb, Ga, La, and Th concentrations, all of which were present in the sediment. The temperature-induced chemical effects were probably caused by (incongruent) dissolution of silicate minerals (K and Si), desorption from, and potentially reductive dissolution of, iron oxides (As, B, Mo, V, and possibly P and DOC), and mineralisation of sedimentary organic matter (DOC and P).},

abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of image pansharpening on Vegetation Indices (VIs), and found that pansharpening was able to downscale single-date and multi-temporal Landsat 8 VI data without introducing significant distortions in VI values. Four fast pansharpening methods—Fast Intensity-Hue-Saturation (FIHS), Brovey Transform (BT), Additive Wavelet Transform (AWT), and Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation (SFIM)—and two VIs—Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Simple Ratio (SR)—were tested. The NDVI and SR formulas were both found to cause some spatial information loss in the pansharpened multispectral (MS) bands, and this spatial information loss from VI transformations was not specific to Landsat 8 imagery (it will occur for any type of imagery). BT, SFIM, and other similar pansharpening methods that inject spatial information from the panchromatic (Pan) band by multiplication, lose all of the injected spatial information after the VI calculations. FIHS, AWT, and other similar pansharpening methods that inject spatial information by addition, lose some spatial information from the Pan band after VI calculations as well. Nevertheless, for all of the single- and multi-date VI images, the FIHS and AWT pansharpened images were more similar to the higher resolution reference data than the unsharpened VI images were, indicating that pansharpening was effective in downscaling the VI data. FIHS best enhanced the spectral and spatial information of the single-date and multi-date VI images, followed by AWT, and neither significantly over- or under-estimated VI values.},

In the frame of BIOSPEC (Linking spectral information at different spatial scales with biophysical parameters of Mediterranean vegetation in the context of global change) and FLUXPEC (Monitoring changes in water and carbon fluxes from remote and proximal sensing in Mediterranean “dehesa” ecosystem) projects LST retrieved from Landsat data is required to integrate ground-based observations of energy, water, and carbon fluxes with multi-scale remotely-sensed data and assess water and carbon balance in ecologically fragile heterogeneous ecosystem of Mediterranean wooded grassland (dehesa). Thus, three methods based on the Radiative Transfer Equation were used to extract LST from a series of 2009–2011 Landsat-5 TM images to assess the applicability for temperature input generation to a Landsat-MODIS LST integration. When compared to surface temperatures simulated using MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) with atmospheric profiles inputs (LSTref), values from Single-Channel (SC) algorithm are the closest (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.50 °C); procedure based on the online Radiative Transfer Equation Atmospheric Correction Parameters Calculator (RTE-ACPC) shows RMSD = 0.85 °C; Mono-Window algorithm (MW) presents the highest RMSD (2.34 °C) with systematical LST underestimation (bias = 1.81 °C). Differences between Landsat-retrieved LST and MODIS LST are in the range of 2 to 4 °C and can be explained mainly by differences in observation geometry, emissivity, and time mismatch between Landsat and MODIS overpasses. There is a seasonal bias in Landsat-MODIS LST differences due to greater variations in surface emissivity and thermal contrasts between landcover components.},

abstract = {The first open ocean deployment of the Skin Depth Experimental Profiler (SkinDeEP) was from the R/V Melville in the Gulf of California during the Marine Optical Characterization Experiment (MOCE-5). SkinDeEP is an autonomous, vertical profiler for the upper few meters of the ocean. During MOCE-5, SkinDeEP was deployed on ten separate occasions, and profiles were made at intervals of approximately 1 min each. A total of 976 profiles was acquired during the cruise. The ocean skin temperatures were measured by the Marine Atmosphere Emitted Radiance Interferometer (M-AERI), an infrared spectroradiometer. Typical meteorological conditions were of low winds and high insolation. The data set provided captures the near-surface temperature structure that decouples the skin layer from the conventional in situ bulk sea surface temperature (SST) measurements made at a depth of a few meters. Data from SkinDeEP showed strong diurnal warming within the upper few meters, with one extreme case of 4.6 K. There were large discrepancies when computing the skin-bulk temperature difference with bulk temperatures at different depths. Results also show the strong dependency of the SST on air-sea heat flux estimates, with warm-layer errors of almost 60 Wm\&\#8722;2 associated with intense stratification. This indicates the importance of the inclusion of the skin temperature for accurate calculation of latent, sensible, and net longwave heat fluxes.},

The temperature dependence of these ratios was calibrated with corals collected at SST recording stations and by (18)O/(16)O thermometry. The results suggest that mean monthly SST may be determined with an apparent accuracy of better than 0.5 degrees C. Measurements on a fossil coral indicate that 10,200 years ago mean annual SSTs near Vanuatu in the southwestern Pacific Ocean were about 5 degrees C colder than today and that seasonal variations in SST were larger.

A series of examples ranging from errors caused by temperature measurements at a monitoring station to the undocumented biases in the regionally and globally averaged time series are provided. The issues are poorly understood or documented and relate to micrometeorological impacts due to warm bias in nighttime minimum temperatures, poor siting of the instrumentation, effect of winds as well as surface atmospheric water vapor content on temperature trends, the quantification of uncertainties in the homogenization of surface temperature data, and the influence of land use/land cover (LULC) change on surface temperature trends. Because of the issues presented in this paper related to the analysis of multidecadal surface temperature we recommend that greater, more complete documentation and quantification of these issues be required for all observation stations that are intended to be used in such assessments.

Microwaves penetrate clouds with little attenuation, giving an uninterrupted view of the ocean surface. This is a distinct advantage over infrared measurements of SST, which are obstructed by clouds. Comparisons with ocean buoys show a root mean square difference of about 0.6°C, which is partly due to the satellite-buoy spatial-temporal sampling mismatch and the difference between the ocean skin temperature and bulk temperature. Microwave SST retrievals provide insights in a number of areas, including tropical instability waves, marine boundary layer dynamics, and the prediction of hurricane intensity.},

In this study, both infrared thermography and theoretical simulation were used to determine the surface temperature distribution during laser irradiation of both gel phantom and animal tumors. Selective photothermal interaction was attempted by using intratumoral indocyanine green enhancement and irradiation via a near-infrared laser. An immunoadjuvant was also used to enhance immunological responses during tumor treatment. Monte Carlo method for tissue absorption of light and finite difference method for heat diffusion in tissue were used to simulate the temperature distribution during the selective laser photothermal interaction. An infrared camera was used to capture the thermal images during the laser treatment and the surface temperature was determined. Our findings show that the theoretical and experimental results are in good agreement and that the surface temperature of irradiated tissue can be controlled with appropriate dye and adjuvant enhancement. These results can be used to control the laser tumor treatment parameters and to optimize the treatment outcome. More importantly, when used with immunotherapy as a precursor of immunological responses, the selective photothermal treatment can be guided by the tissue temperature profiles both in the tumor and on the surface.},

As a useful proxy, the oxygen isotope composition (delta18O) of calcite from planktonic foraminifera has been shown to reflect both surface temperature and seawater delta18O, itself an indicator of global ice volume and salinity. In addition, magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios in foraminiferal calcite show a temperature dependence due to the partitioning of Mg during calcification. Here we demonstrate, in a field-based calibration experiment, that the variation of Mg/Ca ratios with temperature is similar for eight species of planktonic foraminifera (when accounting for Mg dissolution effects). Using a multi-species record from the Last Glacial Maximum in the North Atlantic Ocean we found that past temperatures reconstructed from Mg/Ca ratios followed the two other palaeotemperature proxies: faunal abundance and alkenone saturation. Moreover, combining Mg/Ca and delta18O data from the same faunal assemblage, we show that reconstructed surface water delta18O from all foraminiferal species record the same glacial-interglacial change--representing changing hydrography and global ice volume. This reinforces the potential of this combined technique in probing past ocean-climate interactions.},

abstract = {Air surface temperature (T air) is an important parameter for a wide range of applications such as vector-borne disease bionomics, hydrology and climate change studies. Air temperature data is usually obtained from measurements made in meteorological stations, providing only limited information about spatial patterns over wide areas. The use of remote sensing data can help overcome this problem, particularly in areas with low station density, having the potential to improve the estimation of T air at both regional and global scales. Some studies have tried to derive maximum (T max), minimum (T min) and average air temperature (T avg) using different methods, with variable estimation accuracy; errors generally fall in the 2-3??C range while the level of precision generally considered as accurate is 1-2??C. The main objective of this study was to accurately estimate T max, T min and T avg for a 10year period based on remote sensing-Land Surface Temperature (LST) data obtained from MODIS-and auxiliary data using a statistical approach. An optimization procedure with a mixed bootstrap and jackknife resampling was employed. The statistical models estimated Tavg with a MEF (Model Efficiency Index) of 0.941 and a RMSE of 1.33??C. Regarding T max and T min, the best MEF achieved was 0.919 and 0.871, respectively, with a 1.83 and 1.74??C RMSE. The developed datasets provided weekly 1km estimations and accurately described both the intra and inter annual temporal and spatial patterns of T air. Potential sources of uncertainty and error were also analyzed and identified. The most promising developments were proposed with the aim of developing accurate T air estimations at a larger scale in the future. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {High spatial resolution Landsat imagery is employed in eVorts to understand the impact of human activities on ecological, biogeochemical and atmospheric processes in the Amazon basin. The utility of Landsatmulti-spectral data depends both on the degree to which surface properties can be estimated from the radiometric measurements and on the ability to observe the surface through the atmosphere. Clouds are a major obstacle to optical remote sensing of humid tropical regions, therefore cloud cover probability analysis is a funda- mental prerequisite to land-cover change and Earth system process studies in these regions. This paper reports the results of a spatially explicit analysis of cloud cover in the Landsat archive of Brazilian Amazonia from 1984 to 1997. Monthly observations of any part of the basin are highly improbable using Landsat-like optical imagers. Annual observations are possible for most of the basin, but are improbable in northern parts of the region. These results quantify the limitations imposed by cloud cover to current Amazon land-cover change assessments using Landsat data. They emphasize the need for improved radar and alternative optical data fusion techniques to provide time-series analyses of biogeophysical properties for regional modelling eVorts.},

abstract = {Observations of the Earth's near-surface temperature show a global-mean temperature increase of approximately 0.6 K since 1900 (ref. 1), occurring from 1910 to 1940 and from 1970 to the present. The temperature change over the past 30–50 years is unlikely to be entirely due to internal climate variability2, 3, 4 and has been attributed to changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols5 due to human activity. Attribution of the warming early in the century has proved more elusive. Here we present a quantification of the possible contributions throughout the century from the four components most likely to be responsible for the large-scale temperature changes, of which two vary naturally (solar irradiance and stratospheric volcanic aerosols) and two have changed decisively due to anthropogenic influence (greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols). The patterns of time/space changes in near-surface temperature due to the separate forcing components are simulated with a coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model, and a linear combination of these is fitted to observations. Thus our analysis is insensitive to errors in the simulated amplitude of these responses. We find that solar forcing may have contributed to the temperature changes early in the century, but anthropogenic causes combined with natural variability would also present a possible explanation. For the warming from 1946 to 1996 regardless of any possible amplification of solar or volcanic influence, we exclude purely natural forcing, and attribute it largely to the anthropogenic components.},

abstract = {Accurate estimation of spatially distributed air temperature (Ta) is useful for a wide range of disciplines such as hydrology, meteorology and ecology. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (Ts) products hold the potential to get spatial estimates of land surface temperature at high temporal (daily) and spatial resolution (1km) across the world. In this paper, the possibility of retrieving high-resolution Ta data from MODIS Ts data on both Terra and Aqua satellites was investigated over Xiangride River basin in the north Tibetan Plateau. The results of statistical analysis show that during the night MODIS Ts data on Terra satellite provides a good estimation of daily minimum air temperature with RMSE=2.97°C, MAE=2.37°C, and r=0.94, while during the day the difference between Terra MODIS Ts data and daily maximum air temperature is large with RMSE=7.45°C, MAE=6.21°C, and r=0.83. In order to improve the accuracy of the estimation of daily maximum air temperature, the temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method was used in this paper. By lowering the threshold for the negative correlation coefficient between NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and Ts to −0.1, the TVX method was applied to MODIS land products to estimate daily maximum air temperature successfully for the first time. The validation results show that the TVX method has improved the accuracy of daily maximum air temperature significantly with RMSE=3.79°C, MAE=3.03°C, and r=0.83. Finally, the diurnal air temperature variation was simulated using a simple sine curve model for the period 21:00–9:00UCT. The simulation results were in good agreement with observed values with RMSE=3.43°C, MAE=2.54°C, and r=0.86. The results of this study show that daily maximum and minimum air temperature can be retrieved effectively from MODIS land surface products through the use of TVX method.},

abstract = {With more than 30years of imagery, the Landsat database offers potential insights into changes in the global cryosphere. In this study, a Landsat-based sub-pixel fractional snow covered area retrieval model based on spectral unmixing is applied and validated over a southern Andes study region. An application analyzing minimum annual snow/ice covered areas is presented as an example of the utility of the existence of such a model and the Landsat database. The model was validated using high-resolution imagery aggregated to the nominal Landsat resolution, showing good correlation for both fresh snow and ice/old snow presence. Using annual minimum snow/ice retrievals from Landsat 5 and 7, the presence of trends in each snow/ice-covered pixel area was assessed for the 1986-2013 historical period, and three metrics were examined: pixels with significant negative trends, total area loss, and areas with any absolute negative change. Significant negative (area reduction) trends in most of the glacier fronts were found, with a loss of approximately 15\% of the original 241km2 glacierized/snow area between 1986 and 2011. Trends in fractional values were compared with those derived from traditional binary classification of snow and significant discrepancies were observed. Even though the binary classification identified a greater total areal loss (33 vs. 23km2) when comparing scenes from the beginning and the end of the study period, the fractional algorithm identified a larger number of pixels with significant negative trends between 1986 and 2013 (42.3 vs. 10.5km2). The binary algorithm resulted in consistent overestimations of ice and snow area and does not offer the ability for identifying subpixel changes.

abstract = {The formation of high-density silver nanoparticles and a novel method to precisely control the spacing between nanoparticles by temperature are demonstrated for a tunable surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates. The high-density nanoparticle thin film is accomplished by self-assembling through the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique on a water surface and transferring the particle monolayer to a temperature-responsive polymer membrane. The temperature-responsive polymer membrane allows producing a dynamic surface enhanced Raman scattering substrate. The plasmon peak of the silver nanoparticle film red shifts up to 110 nm with increasing temperature. The high-density particle film serves as an excellent substrate for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and the scattering signal enhancement factor can be dynamically tuned by the thermally activated SERS substrate. The SERS spectra of Rhodamine 6G on a high-density silver particle film at various temperatures is characterized to demonstrate the tunable plasmon coupling between high-density nanoparticles.},

abstract = {Massive scleractinian corals secrete an aragonitic skeleton which incorporates a large array of chemical tracers. Corals present several advantages for palaeoclimate research: they grow continuously, and can live up to 1000 years; they are easy to date; and they can be sampled at high resolution (weekly to monthly resolution). Both live and fossil corals can be collected in the field. In the past two decades, significant efforts have been made to identify robust tracers of sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) in corals. To date, Sr/Ca and $\delta$18O are considered to be the most reliable SST tracers, although changes in seawater $\delta$18O can significantly alter SST reconstructed from coralline $\delta$18O. Because these variations in seawater $\delta$18O can be linked to SSS changes, this initial problem can in fact be turned into an advantage and provide us with an SSS tracer. The SST component in the coral $\delta$18O signal can either be evaluated through Sr/Ca measurements, or in some case simply filtered out. However, there is still much uncertainty concerning the exact mode of incorporation of trace elements and stable isotopes into the coral skeleton. The effects of growth rate, light intensity, feeding habits, pH and water chemistry are still poorly documented. A review of the strength and weaknesses of Sr/Ca and $\delta$18O is presented, together with some examples of SST and SSS reconstructions. Other potential SST tracers are also reviewed. It is expected that the ability to grow corals in aquarium under controlled conditions, and that the development of sophisticated analytical techniques at the micrometric level should help us understand better the robustness of each tracers and the factors controlling their incorporation in coral aragonite. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, to enable integration of ResourceSat-1 into the many existing long-term Landsat projects around the world, practicable similarity must be demonstrated. To quantify the potential for ResourceSat-1 to satisfy some of the needs of the remote sensing community, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from Landsat-5 were compared to NDVI values derived from ResourceSat-1. An intercalibration equation that converts ResourceSat-1 NDVI values to equivalent Landsat-5 NDVI values was derived thereby enabling direct comparison between the two sensors. Comparisons were made using imagery spanning a 3-year time period. Prior to intercalibration, NDVI values were highly correlated (mean R 2 > 0.73) but statistically different (P < 0.001).

abstract = {By the end of this century the Earth Observing System will provide worldwide, thermal infrared, multispectral images of the Earth, presenting geologists with a new kind of remote sensing data for interpretation. Thus it has become essential to understand the spectral emittance behavior of terrestrial surface materials. Perhaps the most fundamental question to be answered is the extent to which such materials follow Kirchhoff's law (epsilon = 1 - R) under laboratory and field conditions, especially when a sample displays a thermal gradient. We present the first rigorous quantitative comparison of directional hemispherical reflectance and directional emittance measurements of rock and soil samples in the laboratory, with thermal gradients induced by heating them from below and allowing them to radiate to a colder background. The results show that only an extremely low density sample composed of fine particles sifted into a ”fairy castle” structure displays a thermal gradient steep enough within the infrared skin depth to cause significant (6\%) departure from Kirchhoff s law. There is no detectable effect on the more normal terrestrial samples, such as soils and rocks measured in the laboratory, even when semitransparent coatings are involved. Thus both emittance and reflectance measurements can be used to calculate sample emissivity for most terrestrial surface materials. However, the effect on Kirchhoffian behavior of different field environments, which may induce a steeper thermal gradient in particulate samples, has yet to be determined, and some low-density surface materials like newly fallen snow, frost, and efflorescent salts on playas have yet to be measured in emittance.},

abstract = {We present the first quantitative representation of the intensity of Yellowstone National Park's surficial geothermal activity mapped continuously in space. A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km2 landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0??W m- 2 up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94??W m- 2 (at the 28.5??m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r = 0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone's famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The results reveal strong directional variations in the observed apparent surface temperature. The variations arise due to the differential patterns of irradiated and shaded surfaces within the sensor field of view created by the three-dimensional urban surface structure and the position of the Sun. The directional variations may be considered to be a form of effective anisotropy due to the large scale roughness of the urban surface. Variations in excess of 9 C were measured over a downtown area. Urban residential and light industrial land-use areas also exhibited strong effective anisotropy. The directional temperature variations are of similar magnitude to atmospheric corrections applied to thermal imagery. This implies that effective anisotropy should receive serious consideration in the interpretation of thermal imagery obtained over urban areas. The scale dependence of the effective anisotropy is discussed.},

abstract = {We analyse shortwave infrared thermal data of the phase 1 eruption of Unzen Volcano (Japan) extracted from eight nighttime Thematic Mapper (TM) images taken from the Landsat 5 satellite between October 1991 and November 1992. We identify two discrete regions of the dome that were heated to high temperature by the ongoing eruptive activity; a fumarolically heated region and an area associated with the effusion of new lava. We concentrate analysis on the fumarolically heated region and investigate the relationships between parameters derived from the infrared radiance data and the nature of the fumarolic gas and magma fluxes. Temporal variations in the parameters derived from the radiance data closely follow those observed in the measured rate of magma effusion. The positive correlation observed between the fumarolically driven shortwave infrared flux and the magma discharge rate (r2 = 0.64) indicates that degassing occurred efficiently and in proportion to the amount of magma supplied. Over our monitoring period, the data suggest that gas accumulation within the edifice did not occur, this conclusion agreeing with a previous finding obtained using correlation spectrometer (COSPEC) analysis of SO2 flux rates. A positive correlation (r2 = 0.56) was also found between the mean radiance of the pixels in the fumarolically heated region and the overall size of that region. This suggests a potential mechanism whereby, when gas pressure within the edifice increased, excess gas escaped through additional pathways to the surface as well through an increased flux at the main fumarolic vents.},

While SAT is the dominant influence on GST during the warm-season, it explains only half of the variance in GST during the cold-season, with SNC and pre-conditioning by prior warm-season SAT also exhibiting a sizeable and, in places, dominant influence. During a period of coincident surface warming and cold-season snowcover decrease in the model 1971 - 1998), mean GST increases are 0.2 degreesC less than those in SAT, a consequence of greater exposure of the ground surface to winter cold air outbreaks. Interpretations of past SAT trends from borehole-based GST reconstructions may therefore be substantially biased by seasonal influences and snow cover changes.},

abstract = {A new algorithm for Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) of land cover using all available Landsat data is developed. It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating "noisy" observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250. pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250. pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98\% and user's accuracies of 86\% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80\%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification. The land cover map with 16 categories resulting from the CCDC algorithm had an overall accuracy of 90\%. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Geologists have used remote sensing data since the advent of the technology for regional mapping, structural interpretation and to aid in prospecting for ores and hydrocarbons. This paper provides a review of multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data, products and applications in geology. During the early days of Landsat Multispectral scanner and Thematic Mapper, geologists developed band ratio techniques and selective principal component analysis to produce iron oxide and hydroxyl images that could be related to hydrothermal alteration. The advent of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) with six channels in the shortwave infrared and five channels in the thermal region allowed to produce qualitative surface mineral maps of clay minerals (kaolinite, illite), sulfate minerals (alunite), carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite), iron oxides (hematite, goethite), and silica (quartz) which allowed to map alteration facies (propylitic, argillic etc.). The step toward quantitative and validated (subpixel) surface mineralogic mapping was made with the advent of high spectral resolution hyperspectral remote sensing. This led to a wealth of techniques to match image pixel spectra to library and field spectra and to unravel mixed pixel spectra to pure endmember spectra to derive subpixel surface compositional information. These products have found their way to the mining industry and are to a lesser extent taken up by the oil and gas sector. The main threat for geologic remote sensing lies in the lack of (satellite) data continuity. There is however a unique opportunity to develop standardized protocols leading to validated and reproducible products from satellite remote sensing for the geology community. By focusing on geologic mapping products such as mineral and lithologic maps, geochemistry, P-T paths, fluid pathways etc. the geologic remote sensing community can bridge the gap with the geosciences community. Increasingly workflows should be multidisciplinary and remote sensing data should be integrated with field observations and subsurface geophysical data to monitor and understand geologic processes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

As El Nino warming was small in 1995, the solar cycle near a minimum, and ozone depletion near record levels, the observed high temperature supports the contention of an underlying global warming trend.

abstract = {The U.S. currently leads the world in installed geothermal capacity with power plants in eight states, and exploration for new electrical-grade geothermal systems is ongoing. Geothermal systems at depth may be identified at the surface by hot springs and fumaroles or by minerals produced by thermal fluids (hydrothermal alteration and hot spring deposits). Northern Fish Lake Valley, Nevada hosts two previously known geothermal fields. This study expanded prospects and identified new areas for future exploration within the valley. We demonstrated the potential for using remote sensing data to evaluate regions that are not well explored. We used visible, near, and shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5. ??m) remote sensing data to map surficial mineralogy. Data were collected by three airborne imaging spectrometer instruments, AVIRIS, HyMap, and ProSpecTIR, each over different parts of Fish Lake Valley. Minerals were identified using diagnostic spectral features. We verified remote sensing results in the field using a portable spectrometer to confirm agreement between field and remote spectra.The discovery of additional geothermal resources in Fish Lake Valley may provide the necessary added incentive to build costly transmission lines to this remote location. We used remote sensing data to delineate four new targets for future geothermal exploration in northern Fish Lake Valley. Two new areas of sinter and travertine deposits were identified northwest of the playa, likely deposited around fault-controlled hot springs during the Pleistocene when the water table was higher. Previously undocumented Miocene crystalline travertine was identified within the Emigrant Hills. Argillic alteration was mapped within ranges, where thermal fluids were likely discharged from faults to alter rhyolite tuff. Here we explain our data processing techniques which include a novel decorrelation stretch designed for geothermal prospecting, and discuss how remote sensing results guided our interpretation of the region's geothermal systems. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Monitoring coastal and inland waters, recognized as case II waters, using the existing Landsat technology is somewhat restricted because of its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its rela- tively poor radiometric resolution. The new generation of Landsat, Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) carrying the Opera- tional Land Imager (OLI), has enhanced features allowing for a more lucid characterization of water constituents in either coastal or inland waters with respect to Landsat-7 (ETM+). This paper applies a physics-based approach to fully examine the potential of OLI in terms of its enhanced features in a water constituent retrieval framework. An EO-1 dataset, including Hyperion and the Advanced Land Imager (ALI), together with nearly coinci- dent ETM+ imagery were atmospherically corrected using a data- driven approach. An in-water radiative transfer model, i.e., Hy- drolight, was applied to generate a Look-Up-Table (LUT) of sim- ulated surface reflectances for various combinations of water con- stituents. Using the Hyperion-derived concentration maps as val- idation sources, it was found that the simulated OLI imagery is superior to ETM+ on the order of 40\%, 20\%, and 28\% when re- trieving the concentrations of chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids (TSS), as well as the absorption of the colored dissolved or- ganic matter (CDOM), respectively. It was also demonstrated that the simulatedOLIimagery outperforms the simulated ALI and the recorded ALI datasets in the retrieval of chlorophyll-a andCDOM absorption. It is concluded that the new generation of Landsat en- ables mapping and monitoring of case II waters with accuracies not achieved with the previous Landsat satellite series.},

abstract = {Air temperature is an important descriptor of terrestrial environmental conditions across the earth. Standard meteorological observations generally provide reasonable descriptions of temporal variations in air temperature for the site sampled but may not describe the spatial heterogeneity typically encountered in this variable over larger land areas. If a reasonable estimate of spatial patterns of air temperature can be derived from satellite remote sensing, this pattern, in combination with the temporal precision of ground measurements, should significantly improve our knowledge of terrestrial environmental conditions. In this study, we explore a methodology for estimating air temperature directly from remotely sensed observations using the (observed) correlation between a spectral vegetation index and surface temperature (temperature-vegetation index). Inference of air temperature is based on the hypothesis that the bulk temperature of an infinitely thick vegetation canopy is close to ambient air temperature. Advanced very high resolution radiometer observations for five sites in northeastern Kansas were used to estimate air temperatures on 31 days during the 1987 growing season. These air temperature estimates were compared with coincident ground-measured air temperatures recorded at standard meteorological stations. A strong correlation (r=0.93) was found between the satellite estimates and measured air temperatures with a mean error of 2.92 C°. However, there was a consistent positive bias in the satellite estimates. It is not clear at this time whether the bias is due to an actual difference between air temperature and the temperature of an infinitely thick canopy or whether it is an artifact of the measurements themselves. Within the errors of the methods used, estimation of standard meteorological shelter height air temperatures recorded at the time of satellite overpass appears possible. Further refinements of the remote sensing methods used here are possible and can be expected in the era of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Observing System.},

Despite genetic, morphometric, physiological and observational studies, it remains unclear whether any population substructure exists. We have used eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to analyse samples from four disparate sampling sites: USA East Coast (Cape Cod), West Greenland, the Faeroe Islands and the UK. Our results indicate that substructure does exist, and is particularly pronounced between West Greenland and other sites. The magnitudes of the various pairwise comparisons do not support a simple isolation-by-distance model. Instead, the patterns of genetic differentiation suggest that population isolation occurs between areas of the ocean which differ in sea surface temperature. Such a mechanism is supported by the observation that temperature is a primary factor determining the relative distributions of two short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus) populations off the Pacific coast of Japan.},

abstract = {The importance of disaster reduction has gained increased awareness within the international development community and thereby highlighted a need for a preliminary assessment of natural hazard risk in developing countries of the Asia-Pacific, including that for volcanic eruption. In this paper, we present a key component of such an assessment, which involved qualifying the frequency and potential consequences of large-Volcanic Explosivity Index of four or more-volcanic eruptions. The frequencies of large eruptions from volcanoes grouped by region were determined from frequency-magnitude plots using data provided by the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program. However, calculated frequencies represent only minimum values due to an incomplete eruption record. Unfortunately, limited data precluded the calculation of eruption frequencies for the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Samoa. A first-order analysis of the populations potentially impacted by large volcanic eruptions suggest that (1) volcanic disasters affecting populations of > 100,000 can be expected at least every decade in Indonesia and once every few decades in the Philippines and (2) a volcanic disaster impacting > 1\% of the population can be expected twice a century in Vanuatu, twice a millennium for Indonesia and the Philippines, and around every millennium in Papua New Guinea and Tonga.},

abstract = {In this paper a method for evaluating land surface temperature (LST) algorithms over heterogeneous areas is presented. The evaluation was made for a set of 12 algorithms derived by using the split-window (SW) and dual-angle (DA) techniques for estimating sea and land surface temperature (SST and LST) from Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data. A validation of the proposed algorithms was carried out over a heterogeneous region of Morocco in the framework of the WATERMED (WATer use Efficiency in natural vegetation and agricultural areas by Remote sensing in the MEDiterranean basin) project. AATSR data and in situ measurements over this heterogenous region were compared by implementing a classification based strategy over a higher spatial resolution Landsat image. Three reference classes were considered when performing the classification from the Landsat image. Ground based measurements where then used to assign an effective surface radiometric temperature to each of these three classes. Finally, an averaging procedure based on class proportion was implemented for deriving surface radiometric temperature at the AATSR pixel scale. For this heterogeneous site, the results showed that LST can be obtained with a root mean-square error (RMSE) lower than 1.7 K from the split-window algorithms. Dual-angle algorithms, on the other hand, provided greater RMSE due to the different surfaces observed in the nadir and forward views. The results suggest that to retrieve LST from 1 km pixels over heterogeneous surfaces spatial averaging is required to improve accuracy on temperature estimation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this study, the potential of EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) radiometer for land cover and especially burnt area mapping from a single image analysis is investigated. Co-orbital imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) was also utilised for comparison purposes. Both images were acquired shortly after the suppression of a fire occurred during the summer of 2009 North-East of Athens, the capital of Greece. The Maximum Likelihood (ML), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifiers were parameterised and subsequently applied to the acquired satellite datasets. Evaluation of the land use/cover mapping accuracy was based on the error matrix statistics. Also, the McNemar test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences between the approaches tested. Derived burnt area estimates were validated against the operationally deployed Services and Applications For Emergency Response (SAFER) Burnt Scar Mapping service. All classifiers applied to either ALI or TM imagery proved flexible enough to map land cover and also to extract the burnt area from other land surface types. The highest total classification accuracy and burnt area detection capability was returned from the application of SVMs to ALI data. This was due to the SVMs ability to identify an optimal separating hyperplane for best classes' separation that was able to better utilise ALI's advanced technological characteristics in comparison to those of TM sensor. This study is to our knowledge the first of its kind, effectively demonstrating the benefits of the combined application of SVMs to ALI data further implying that ALI technology may prove highly valuable in mapping burnt areas and land use/cover if it is incorporated into the development of Landsat 8 mission, planned to be launched in the coming years. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The surface sublayer is the layer of air adjacent to the surface where the transfer of momentum and heat by molecular motion becomes important. Equations are derived to incorporate this surface sublayer (or the variable ratio of the roughness length for momentum over that for heat, z sub(o)/z sub(oh)) over bare soil into a commonly used formulation for aerodynamic transfer coefficients. Along with the consideration of the laminar layer around vegetation leaves in the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS), these equations provide a consistent approach for the computation of surface fluxes over bare soil or vegetated surface. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that the surface sublayer tends to substantially increase the surface skin temperature for a given sensible heat flux and decrease the heat flux for a given surface versus air temperature difference. Using a climate model output as the atmospheric forcing data for BATS over a semiarid region, it is also found that the surface sublayer significantly increases the monthly and July-averaged hourly surface skin temperature and decreases surface sensible heat and net radiation fluxes. Comparison with limited observations of z sub(o)/z sub(oh) also suggests that the same (or different) exchange coefficients should be used over bare soil and vegetated portions in a grid box for dense canopies (e.g., grassland or forest) [or sparse canopies (e.g., semiarid regions)].},

abstract = {An extension of the simple stochastic climate model of Frankignoul and Hasselman that includes the effects of seasonal variations in upper-ocean mixed layer depth upon the persistence of winter sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies is proposed. Seasonal variations in mixed layer depth allow for the "reemergence mechanism,'' whereby thermal anomalies stored in the deep winter mixed layer persist at depth through summer and become partially reentrained into the mixed layer during the following winter. In this way, SST anomalies can recur from winter to winter without persisting through the intervening summer. Reformulating the simple stochastic climate model in terms of an effective ocean thermal capacity given by the depth of the winter mixed layer, thereby implicitly taking into account reemergence, is shown to provide a favorable fit to the observed winter-to-winter SST autocorrelations in the North Atlantic and Pacific, and represents a considerable improvement over the original model. The extended model also compares favorably with results from an entraining bulk ocean mixed layer model coupled to an atmospheric general circulation model. The authors propose that the extended model be adopted as the new "null hypothesis'' for interannual SST variability in middle and high latitudes.},

abstract = {The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) transports warm salty surface waters to high latitudes, where they cool, sink and return southwards at depth. Through its attendant meridional heat transport, the AMOC helps maintain a warm northwestern European climate, and acts as a control on the global climate. Past climate fluctuations during the Holocene epoch ( approximately 11,700 years ago to the present) have been linked with changes in North Atlantic Ocean circulation. The behaviour of the surface flowing salty water that helped drive overturning during past climatic changes is, however, not well known. Here we investigate the temperature and salinity changes of a substantial surface inflow to a region of deep-water formation throughout the Holocene. We find that the inflow has undergone millennial-scale variations in temperature and salinity ( approximately 3.5 degrees C and approximately 1.5 practical salinity units, respectively) most probably controlled by subpolar gyre dynamics. The temperature and salinity variations correlate with previously reported periods of rapid climate change. The inflow becomes more saline during enhanced freshwater flux to the subpolar North Atlantic. Model studies predict a weakening of AMOC in response to enhanced Arctic freshwater fluxes, although the inflow can compensate on decadal timescales by becoming more saline. Our data suggest that such a negative feedback mechanism may have operated during past intervals of climate change.},

abstract = {Thermal activity monitoring in and around active volcanic areas using remote sensing is an essential part of volcanology nowadays. Three identical approaches were used for thermal activity exploration at Aso volcanic area in Japan using Landsat ETM+images. First, the conventional methods for hydrothermal alteration mapping were applied to find the most active thermal region after exploring geothermal indicator minerals. Second, we found some thermally highly anomalous regions around Nakadake crater using land surface temperature estimation. Then, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation was used for estimating and also monitoring radiative heat flux (RHF) from the most active region of about 8km2 in and around Nakadake crater in the central part of the Aso volcano. To fulfill the required parameter in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux, the NDVI (Normalized differential vegetation index) method was used for spectral emissivity, and the mono-window algorithm was used for land surface temperature of this study area. The NDVI value was used to divide land-cover in the study area into four types: water, bare ground, mixed and vegetated land. The bare land was found within the most active region. Vegetation coverage area showed an inverse relationship with total RHF in this study as health of thermally stressed vegetation supports this relationship. The spatial distribution of spectral emissivity ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 in our study. Land surface temperature was estimated using a mono-window algorithm and was highest LST in 2008 and lowest in 2011. The results of RHF showed that the highest pixel RHF was found to be about 296W/m2 in 2008. Total RHF was obtained of about 607MW in 2002 and the lowest was about 354MW in 2008. The RHF anomaly area was found the highest in 2002 and was lowest in 2011. The highest total heat discharge rate (HDR) obtained about 3918MW in 2002 and lowest total HDR about 2289MW in 2008 from this study area. But in the case of Nakadake crater alone, the higher thermal activity was observed in 2008 and was less in 2004. The study showed that Landsat thermal infrared is the best option for thermal activity exploration and monitoring at Aso volcano as well as in any active volcano region considering high efficiency and low cost. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

These interannual variations were detected and analyzed for 1982-90 with a multivariate spectral method. The two most dominant signals for 1982-90 had periods of about 2.6 and 3.4 yr. Signals centered at 2.6 years per cycle corresponded to variations in the El Nino-Southern Oscillation index and explained about 28\% of the variance in anomalies of SST, land surface air temperature, precipitation, and vegetation; these signals were most pronounced in 1) SST anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, 2) land surface vegetation and precipitation anomalies in tropical and subtropical regions, and 3) land surface vegetation, precipitation, and temperature anomalies in North America. Signals at 3.4 years per cycle corresponded to variations in the North Atlantic oscillation index and explained 8.6\% of the variance in the combined datasets; their occurrence was most pronounced in 1) Atlantic SST anomalies, 2) in land surface temperature and vegetation anomalies in Europe and eastern Asia, and 3) in precipitation and vegetation anomalies in sub-Saharan Africa, southern Africa, and eastern North America. Anomalies in vegetation were positively related to anomalies in precipitation throughout the Tropics and subtropics and in midlatitudes in the central parts of continents. Anomalies in vegetation and temperature were positively linked in coastal temperate climates such as in Europe and eastern Asia. These associations between temperature and vegetation may be explained by the sensitivity of the length of growing season to variations in temperature.},

abstract = {Recent photographic documentation of poor siting conditions at stations in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) has led to questions regarding the reliability of surface temperature trends over the conterminous United States (CONUS). To evaluate the potential impact of poor siting/instrument exposure on CONUS temperatures, trends derived from poor and well sitedUSHCNstations were compared. Results indicate that there is a mean bias associated with poor exposure sites relative to good exposure sites; however, this bias is consistent with previously documented changes associated with the widespread conversion to electronic sensors in the USHCN during the last 25 years. Moreover, the sign of the bias is counterintuitive to photographic documentation of poor exposure because associated instrument changes have led to an artificial negative (“cool”) bias in maximum temperatures and only a slight positive (“warm”) bias in minimum temperatures. These results underscore the need to consider all changes in observation practice when determining the impacts of siting irregularities. Further, the influence of nonstandard siting on temperature trends can only be quantified through an analysis of the data. Adjustments applied to USHCN Version 2 data largely account for the impact of instrument and siting changes, although a small overall residual negative (“cool”) bias appears to remain in the adjusted maximum temperature series. Nevertheless, the adjusted USHCN temperatures are extremely well aligned with recent measurements from instruments whose exposure characteristics meet the highest standards for climate monitoring. In summary, we find no evidence that the CONUS average temperature trends are inflated due to poor station siting.},

abstract = {This paper reviews methods for estimating evaporation from landscapes, regions and larger geographic extents, with remotely sensed surface temperatures, and highlights uncertainties and limitations associated with those estimation methods. Particular attention is given to the validation of such approaches against ground based flux measurements. An assessment of some 30 published validations shows an average root mean squared error value of about 50 W m(-2) and relative errors of 15-30\%. The comparison also shows that more complex physical and analytical methods are not necessarily more accurate than empirical and statistical approaches. While some of the methods were developed for specific land covers (e.g. irrigation areas only) we also review methods developed for other disciplines, such as hydrology and meteorology, where continuous estimates in space and in time are needed, thereby focusing on physical and analytical methods as empirical methods are usually limited by in situ training data. This review also provides a discussion of temporal and spatial scaling issues associated with the use of thermal remote sensing for estimating evaporation. Improved temporal scaling procedures are required to extrapolate instantaneous estimates to daily and longer time periods and gap-filling procedures are needed when temporal scaling is affected by intermittent satellite coverage. It is also noted that analysis of multi-resolution data from different satellite/sensor systems (i.e. data fusion) will assist in the development of spatial scaling and aggregation approaches, and that several biological processes need to be better characterized in many current land surface models.},

abstract = {The surface temperature of Utah's hypersaline Great Salt Lake is examined between 2000 and 2007 using 3345 images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the NASA Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua platforms. This study shows the utility of using a multi-year record of the easily accessible and fully processed MODIS thermal imagery to monitor spatial, diurnal, seasonal, and annual variations in the surface water temperature (SWT) of lakes where long-term in situ measurements are rarely available. A cloud-free Terra image is available on average every day during the summer and early fall, every other day during spring and late fall, and every third day during the winter. MODIS-derived lake SWT exhibits a cool bias (\~{} - 1.5 °C) relative to in situ temperature observations gathered from three buoys and a slowly-moving watercraft. The dominant SWT signal is the annual cycle (with a range of 26 °C and peak temperature in mid-July) while the diurnal range is as large as 4 °C during the spring season. Year-to-year variations in SWT are largest during the fall with over 1 °C anomalously warm (cold) departures from the 8-year monthly medians observed during fall 2001 (2006). The MODIS imagery provides an updated SWT climatology for operational weather forecasting applications (e.g., lake-effect snow storm prediction) as well as for input into operational and research numerical weather prediction models. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In the last decade, the number of offshore wind farms has increased rapidly. Offshore wind farms are typically constructed in near-shore, shallow waters. These waters can be highly productive or provide nursery grounds for fish. EU legislation requires assessment of the environmental impact of the wind farms. The effects on hard and soft substrate fauna, seabirds and marine mammals are most frequently considered. Here we present Landsat-8 imagery that reveals the impact of offshore wind farms on suspended sediments. Turbid wakes of individual turbines are observed that are aligned with tidal currents. They are 30-150. m wide, and several km in length. The environmental impact of these wakes and the source of the suspended material are still unclear, but the wake size warrants further study. The underwater light field will be affected by increased suspended sediments and the turbid wakes could significantly impact sediment transport and downstream sedimentation. The question of whether such features can be detected by other remote sensors is addressed by a theoretical analysis of the signal:noise specification for the Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM. +), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3), the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and by a demonstration of the impact of processing OLI data for different spatial resolutions. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {Surface roughness is an important variable of geomorphologic research and hydrological modeling, and widely used in the Earth and planetary science. It plays an important role in determining how a ground object will interact with its environment. Quantification of surface-roughness variability using Digital elevation model (DEM) were applied to study area of Beichuan County, one of the most destructed areas during the Wenchuan earthquake (7.9 Mw at 14:28:01.42 CST on May 12, 2008). In this paper, four types of DEM were chosen for multi-scale assessment of the surface roughness. Three algorithms were employed, which were Root mean square of elevation, standard deviation of elevation, standard deviation of curvature profile. An overall trend of inclined to be flat from pre-earthquake to post-earthquake could be examined through the three measure methods, which indicate that Wenchuan earthquake indeed had effects on changing the surface roughness. The method of Root mean square of elevation shows the most obvious results in depicting the change before and after the earthquake. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Our results extend previous conclusions that recent Northern Hemisphere surface temperature increases are likely anomalous in a long-term context. Recent warmth appears anomalous for at least the past 1,300 years whether or not tree-ring data are used. If tree-ring data are used, the conclusion can be extended to at least the past 1,700 years, but with additional strong caveats. The reconstructed amplitude of change over past centuries is greater than hitherto reported, with somewhat greater Medieval warmth in the Northern Hemisphere, albeit still not reaching recent levels.},

If decadal fluctuations in North Atlantic sea surface temperature1–6 could be predicted, it might be possible to exploit their influence on the atmosphere7–10 to forecast decadal fluctuations in climate11. Here we report analyses of shipboard observations that indicate significant decadal predictability of North Atlantic sea surface temperature, arising from the advective propagation of sea-surfacetemperature anomalies4 and the existence of a regular period of 12–14 years in the propagating signals. The same timescale can be identified in a dipole-like pattern of North Atlantic sea-level pressure variability1,7,12. We propose a mechanism which may connect these oceanic and atmospheric fluctuations, possibly as part of a coupled ocean–atmosphere mode of variability7. Our results are encouraging for the prospects of forecasting natural fluctuations in the climate of the North Atlantic region several years in advance.},

abstract = {Prediction of the regression rate of polymeric fuels is important, especially for the optimal design of solid fuel ramjets or hybrid rocket motors. The burning surface temperature and the surface activation energy in the Arrhenius pyrolysis equation are required for prediction of the regression rate. As a typical polymeric fuel, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was chosen for the present study. The burning surface temperature of PMMA was measured for both end-burning and sandwich-burning experimental devices. In the end-burning experiment, the oxygen flow impinged on the top of the specimen to burn the PMMA. In the sandwich-burning experiment, PMMA sheets were sandwiched between AP pellets. Temperature profiles near the burning surface were measured with a thermocouple embedded in the specimen. Simultaneously, the emergence of the thermocouple from the burning surface was determined with a video camera. The burning surface temperature obtained in the present study was found to be almost independent of the regression rate. The surface activation energy of PMMA was more than 1000 kJ/mol. Our measured surface temperature or the activation energy differs from the values measured with a thermocouple in previous studies. This difference probably is a result of mistaken identification of the burning surface temperature in the previous studies, because it was found that the sudden change or tiny plateau of the slope, in the temperature profile of PMMA, did not signal the burning surface. © 2004 The Combustion Institute.

By analyzing the energy budget of the troposphere, we find that changes are dominated by processes robustly simulated by GCMs. Importantly, shortwave cloud feedbacks, whose uncertainty is largely responsible for the wide range of GCM temperature climate sensitivities, are shown to have little effect. This is because these mainly arise from the scattering of shortwave radiation that has little impact on the tropospheric heating that controls precipitation. Hence, we expect that the range of simulated precipitation sensitivities to temperature will not change greatly in future GCMs, despite the recent suggestion that satellite observations indicate that GCM precipitation changes are significantly in error.},

By scanning the same area of the surface at temperatures from 51 °C to 25 °C it was possible to track geometrical changes of individual nanobubbles as the temperature was decreased. Interestingly, nanobubbles of the same size react differently to this temperature change; some grow whilst others shrink. This effect cannot be attributed to Ostwald ripening, since the growth and shrinkage of nanobubbles appears to occur in distinct patches on the substrate. The total nanobubble volume per unit area shows a maximum around 33 °C, which is comparable with literature where experiments were carried out with increasing temperature. This underlines the stability of surface nanobubbles.},

abstract = {Trees are essential in a dense urban environment not only because of their aesthetic value, but also for their cooling effect during hot periods, which impacts directly on the local microclimate. However, certain trees cope better with high urban temperatures than others. Here, we report tree crown temperatures of 10 common tree species frequently planted in Central European cities (in part, supplemented with stomatal conductance data, gs). Parts of the city of Basel, Switzerland (7° 4 1′ E/47 ° 3 4′ N) were scanned from a helicopter using a high-resolution thermal camera. A histogram of the composite image shows peaks at 18° C (water), 26° C (vegetation), 37° C (streets) and a less obvious one at 45° C (roofs). At an ambient temperature of c. 25° C, tree crown temperatures ranged from c. 24° C (Aesculus hippocastanum trees located in a park) to 29° C in Acer platanoides trees, located in a street. Trees in parks were significantly cooler (c. 26° C) than trees surrounded by sealed ground (c. 27° C). The only coniferous species, Pinus sylvestris did not vary in temperature with location (park or street) and exhibited foliage temperature close to air temperature. Generally, small-leaved trees remained cooler than large-leaved trees. Stomatal conductance data collected during similar weather conditions suggest that there was no bias in crown temperatures due to locally different water supply between trees. Although the highest leaf temperatures of individuals of A. platanoides reached over 5 K leaf-to-air temperature difference ($\Delta$ TL - A), we do not expect temperature stress to occur in these conditions. In order to estimate possible effects of future temperature extremes on $\Delta$ TL - A, we evaluated the leaf energy balance for a range of stomatal responses and air temperatures, using leaf size, wind speed and the measured species-specific leaf boundary layer resistance. At an ambient temperature of 40° C, $\Delta$ TL - A ranged from 2 to 5 K when gs was assumed to drop linearly to 50\% of its maximum value. When gs was compromised further (20\% of species-specific maxima), the difference in $\Delta$ TL - A between species became larger with rising ambient temperature (range 4-10 K). Those species with the lowest leaf temperatures at 25° C were not necessarily coolest at 40° C. Species-specific differences in $\Delta$ TL - A under extreme temperatures as shown here may be useful for urban tree planning in order to optimise management cost and human comfort. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The new panchromatic band 8 covers wavelengths of 0.52-0.92 mum and extends over band 2 (0.525-0.605 mum), band 3 (0.630-0.690 mum) and band 4 (0.750-0.900 mum). Its high resolution, with a pixel length of 15 m, is of interest for high-spatial-resolution analysis. This project focused oil using Landsat 7 band 8 as a precise tool to obtain remotely the size and shape of permanent snowpatches in the mountainous area west of Abisko, Sweden. In the supervised classification employed, shadowed and non-shadowed areas were classified separately. Supervision of the classification was based on ground-truthing consisting of photographic mapping of the snow cover in the study area. The results from this single-band classification were compared to the results from the normalized- difference snow index (NDSI) and false-color images using bands 2,4 and 5. This comparison showed similar estimates of the total amount of snow-covered area, with the additional advantage that the Landsat 7 band 8 (LB8) classification detects details in the extent of individual snowfields. This new application and the insights documented here support the use of Landsat 7 band 8 for snow-cover investigations in the future.},

This allows retrieving the land surface emissivity and temperature from satellite microwave brightness temperatures after atmospheric corrections. Over the Canadian sub-arctic continental area, we show that the main factor modifying the emissivity is the fraction of water surface (FWS) within a pixel. Accordingly, a map of the fraction of water surface across the Canadian landmass is derived, given a correspondence within 6\% as compared to the 1 km2 Canadian National Topographic Database of water-covered areas. The microwave-derived surface temperatures are compared to synchronous in situ air and ground surface temperatures and also with independent satellite IR measurements over areas without snow or ice. Root mean square differences range between 2° and 3.5°, with mean bias error of the order of 1-3°. Better results are always obtained with the 37 GHz channel rather than with the 19 GHz channel. Over dense vegetation, the microwave-derived surface temperature is closer to the air temperature (at surface level) than to the ground temperature. The proposed simple retrieval algorithm, not sensitive to cloud cover, appears very useful for monitoring summer interannual or seasonal trends of the fraction of surface water, as well as the daily land surface temperature variation, which are very important parameters in environmental change analysis. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {A heat transfer model is constructed to derive the surface temperature of specimens in outdoor weathering. Data on thermal properties of materials and routinely collected weather data are used as inputs for the model. The model is validated against surface temperature data measured on samples of 11 different materials exposed to natural outdoor weathering in Jokioinen, Finland, over a period of 12 months. The agreement between the model and the surface measurements is more than satisfactory with a mean difference less than 0.5 K and a root-mean-square difference ranging from 0.4 to 1.4 K (0.1-0.5\%), depending on material. The mean differences between the surface and ambient temperatures range from -0.1 to 1.3 K. Use of ambient temperature instead of sample surface temperature is shown to lead to severe misjudgements in estimations of reaction rates. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We analyse the Mw 7.7 Balochistan earthquake of 09/24/2013 based on ground surface deformation measured from sub-pixel correlation of Landsat-8 images, combined with back-projection and finite source modeling of teleseismic waveforms. The earthquake nucleated south of the Chaman strike-slip fault and propagated southwestward along the Hoshab fault at the front of the Kech Band. The rupture was mostly unilateral, propagated at 3 km/s on average and produced a 200 km surface fault trace with purely strike-slip displacement peaking to 10 m and averaging around 6 m. The finite source model shows that slip was maximum near the surface. Although the Hoshab fault is dipping by 45?? to the North, in accordance with its origin as a thrust fault within the Makran accretionary prism, slip was nearly purely strike-slip during that earthquake. Large seismic slip on such a non-optimally oriented fault was enhanced possibly due to the influence of the free surface on dynamic stresses or to particular properties of the fault zone allowing for strong dynamic weakening. Strike-slip faulting on thrust fault within the eastern Makran is interpreted as due to eastward extrusion of the accretionary prism as it bulges out over the Indian plate. Portions of the Makran megathrust, some thrust faults in the Kirthar range and strike-slip faults within the Chaman fault system have been brought closer to failure by this earthquake. Aftershocks cluster within the Chaman fault system north of the epicenter, opposite to the direction of rupture propagation. By contrast, few aftershocks were detected in the area of maximum moment release. In this example, aftershocks cannot be used to infer earthquake characteristics. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Regional fault patterns contribute important information for preliminary exploration for mineralized areas and characterization of geologic structure. Faults may correspond with lineaments appearing on remotely sensed images. In this paper, a new lineament identification method, namely the Segment Tracing Algorithm (STA), is proposed, and its application in mountainous areas of southwestern Japan is discussed. The principle of the STA is to detect a line of pixels as a vector element by examining local variance of the gray level in the digital image, and to connect retained line elements along their expected directions. The threshold values for the extraction and the linkage of line elements are direction dependent. The advantages of the proposed method over usual filtering methods are its capability to (1) trace only continuous valleys and (2) extract more lineaments that parallel the sun's azimuth and those located in shadow areas. A LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) subscene was used for the analysis. The band 4 subscene of the LANDSAT TM image was determined to be appropriate for the lineament analysis by comparing several images with a shaded-relief image derived from a digital elevation model (DEM).},

abstract = {The historical record of volcanic eruptions is extremely important for natural hazard reduction, especially in densely inhabited areas. In concert with clarification of contradictory points in the historical eruptions' record, we have modified the locality, eruption size, and timing of submarine volcanic eruptions around Taiwan. Three out of five submarine eruption records (catalog numbers 080104, 0801-05 and 0802-01) in northern offshore Taiwan can be clearly traced. These events indicate that volcanic activity in this area is still in progress; and hence a program for volcanic hazard reduction should be seriously considered in northern Taiwan. Two events (catalog numbers 0801-03 and 0801-02) shown to have occurred in the southeast offshore region of Taiwan appear to be related to the Eurasian Continental Plate's eastwardly subduction under the Philippine Sea Plate. However, the new seismic wave travel time tomography of the subduction zone will be needed to clarify this. The refined results shall contribute to the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program and the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCEI) for editing the next version of the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World.},

abstract = {The hazards of volcanic ash to modern aviation are now widely known, and there is a concerted global effort on the part of volcano observatories, meteorological services, and civil aviation authorities to keep aircraft out of harm’s way. A major issue with providing rapid notification of dangerous eruptions is that only about 50\% of the world's volcanoes that currently threaten air operations have any sort of ground-based, real-time monitoring; thus, timely detection of explosive eruptions is more difficult owing to reliance on satellite remote sensing. We have been evaluating the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN, see http://wwlln.net) as a tool to detect volcanogenic lightning associated with explosive eruptions worldwide to aid rapid eruption reporting for aviation. The WWLLN has a data latency of one minute and thus can detect and report volcanogenic lightning in near-real time. We compared explosive volcanic activity worldwide (data from the Smithsonian’s Global Volcanism Program, volcano observatory reports, Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) reports, and ancillary data sources) with the entire catalog of WWLLN data for 2008 and 2009 to determine the eruption-detection capabilities of the system. Duration and number of WWLLN lightning detections is positively correlated with eruption magnitude. In 2008 the WWLLN detected lightning from all eruptions VEI 4 or larger (Chaiten, Chile; Kasatochi and Okmok, Alaska, USA), as well as four out of six of the \~{}VEI 3 and two \~{}VEI 2 eruptions. In 2009 the WWLLN detected the single VEI 4 eruption (Sarychev Peak, Kurile Islands, Russia), four out six of the \~{}VEI 3 and a single VEI 2 eruption. At volcanoes where eruption-onset times are well determined by seismic or remote sensing means, lightning flashes started within 4 to 58 minutes of eruption onset. Lightning was detected from eruptions that produced ash clouds with heights that ranged from approximately 1–15 km above the vent, with most >9 km. Detected volcanogenic lightning was produced by a wide range of eruptive styles and product compositions, and the number of detected flashes is positively correlated with the altitude of the ash cloud, intensity of the eruption, and the inferred abundance of water in the shallow subsurface. The WWLLN is growing steadily, consisting of about 35 networked stations in 2008, 40 stations in 2009 and over 50 stations by mid-2010. A denser network will yield more consistent detection of volcanogenic lightning associated with smaller eruptions. WWLLN data alone can be useful as an indicator of explosive activity, particularly in regions with low ambient lightning, but is best utilized in conjunction with other monitoring data streams to provide valuable corroborative data to aid in rapid detection of larger explosive eruptions globally. A software suite is being developed to use WWLLN data for this purpose.},

abstract = {An array of surface science measurements has revealed novel water adsorption behavior at the Fe(3)O(4)(001) surface. Following room temperature exposure to water, a low coverage of hydrogen atoms is observed, with no associated water hydroxyl group. Mild annealing of the hydrogenated surface leads to desorption of water via abstraction of surface oxygen atoms, leading to a reduction of the surface. These results point to an irreversible splitting of the water molecule. The observed phenomena are discussed in the context of recent DFT calculations (Mulakaluri, N.; Pentcheva, R.; Scheffler, M. J. Phys. Chem. C 2010, 114, 11148), which show that the Jahn-Teller distorted surface isolates adsorbed H in a geometry that could kinetically hinder recombinative desorption. In contrast, the adsorption geometry facilitates interaction between water hydroxyl species, which are concluded to leave the surface following a reactive desorption process, possibly via the creation of O(2).},

abstract = { Airborne hyperspectral technology' has progressed to global implementation possibilities for geothermal exploration and assessment. This work describes the unique capabilities of hyperspectral imagers as they pertain to the mapping and characterization of geothermal regions including both geological and biological material mapping. Many of the geological processes, phenomena and products (such as alteration) associated with regions of high geothermal gradients can be imaged, measured, geospatially placed and identified accurately and precisely over large, contiguous areas in virtually any region of the globe by aircraft-mounted imaging spectrometers such as HyMap. For example traditional drilling and field surveys provide extensive mineralogical data at depth and over very small areas. Such activities are considered mandatory in any geothermal exploration program. However hyperspectral remote sensing has the capability to accurately map continuous surface mineralogy over very large areas at small spatial scales (eg. siliceous sinter, travertine or alunite distribution). While resource satellites such as Landsat and ASTER do provide global coverage of basic geology at relatively low spatial resolutions (15-30 m) and low spectral resolutions (40-700 nm), directed high spatial and spectral resolution airborne surveys with HyMap (3-5 m spatial and 13-17 nm spectral) afford incomparable material map generation capabilities. These include not only the specific mineral identification maps discussed above, but also mineral chemistry measurements, proxy temperature estimates and associated geobotanical measurements and distribution maps (that include not only types of vegetation but also relative physiological state).},

abstract = {The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model uses remotely sensed maps of land-surface temperature (LST) along with local air temperature estimates at a nominal blending height to model heat and water fluxes across a landscape, partitioned between dual sources of canopy and soil. For operational implementation of TSEB, however, it is often difficult to obtain representative air temperature data that are compatible with the LST retrievals, which may themselves have residual errors due to atmospheric and emissivity corrections. To address this issue, two different strategies in applying the TSEB model without requiring local air temperature data were tested over a typical Mediterranean agricultural area using a set of high-resolution multispectral airborne remote sensing images. Alleviating the need for accurate local air temperature data as input, these two approaches estimate the surface-to-air temperature gradient that drives the sensible heat flux by directly exploiting the information available in the image. The two approaches include: 1) a scene-based internal calibration (TSEB-IC) procedure that estimates air temperature over a well-watered and fully vegetated pixel in the LST image, and 2) a disaggregation scheme (DisALEXI) that uses air temperature estimates from a time-differential coupled TSEB-atmospheric boundary layer model of atmosphere-land exchange (ALEXI). A comparison of the air temperatures modeled by TSEB-IC and DisALEXI with in situ weather station observations shows good agreement, with average differences on the order of 1K, comparable with the uncertainties in the remotely sensed surface temperature maps. Surface fluxes estimated by each method agree well with micro-meteorological measurements acquired over an olive orchard within the aircraft imaging domain. In comparison with fluxes generated with TSEB using local measurements of air temperature, instantaneous fluxes from these alternative methods show good spatial agreement, with differences of less than 10Wm -2 across the domain. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the three models, performed by introducing artificial errors into the model inputs, demonstrates that the DisALEXI and TSEB-IC approaches are relatively insensitive to errors in absolute surface temperature calibration, while turbulent fluxes from TSEB applications using local air temperature measurements show sensitivity of approximately 30Wm -2 per degree temperature perturbation. This highlights the value of both internal calibration and time-differential estimation of the surface-to-air temperature gradient within a surface energy balance framework. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal distributions of snow grain size, mass fraction of snow impurity, and snow surface temperature around the northern polar region were retrieved together with snow and sea ice cover extents from radiance data observed by the Global Imager (GLI), an optical sensor onboard Japan's Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II (ADEOS-II). The sensor acquired global radiance data from April 2 to October 24 in 2003. Two grain sizes, one for the shallow (0–20 cm) layer and the other for the top surface (0–2 cm) layer, were retrieved using channels with different light penetration depths. Snow and sea ice related products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used for comparison. Retrieved seasonal variations of snow and sea ice cover extents were consistent with the MODIS and AMSR products. GLI derived snow surface temperatures were also correlated with the MODIS surface temperatures and exhibited latitudinal dependence over the northern hemisphere. Retrieved snow impurities were considered to be partly inaccurate over the Arctic sea ice in April and over inland areas of the continents possibly due to thin snow and/or dense vegetation. However, the snow cover around the northern Canadian Arctic tundra and Archipelago regions and the Greenland ice sheet in April to June was found to be very clean with a soot-equivalent impurity fraction of around 0.05 ppmw or less. Thus, these areas can be used as reference sites for monitoring pollution levels of the Arctic snow cover. Retrieved snow grain radii in the shallow layer seemed erroneous over thin snow covers, but indicated drastic spatial and seasonal evolution of the snow cover over the northern hemisphere with radius ranging from 50 $\mu$m to over 1000 $\mu$m synchronized with variations in surface temperature. The spatial variability of the top surface grain radius was partly different from that of the grain size in the shallow layer suggesting the possibility of detecting vertical inhomogeneity of the top 10 cm of the snow cover.},

abstract = {Distributed glacier surface melt models are often forced using air temperature fields that are either downscaled from climate models or reanalysis, or extrapolated from station measurements. Typically, the downscaling and/or extrapolation are performed using a constant temperature lapse rate, which is often taken to be the free-air moist adiabatic lapse rate (MALR: 6 degrees-7 degrees C km(-1)). To explore the validity of this approach, the authors examined altitudinal gradients in daily mean air temperature along six transects across four glaciers in the Canadian high Arctic. The dataset includes over 58 000 daily averaged temperature measurements from 69 sensors covering the period 1988-2007. Temperature lapse rates near glacier surfaces vary on both daily and seasonal time scales, are consistently lower than the MALR(ablation season mean: 4.9 degrees C km(-1)), and exhibit strong regional covariance. A significant fraction of the daily variability in lapse rates is associated with changes in free-atmospheric temperatures (higher temperatures 5 lower lapse rates). The temperature fields generated by downscaling point location summit elevation temperatures to the glacier surface using temporally variable lapse rates are a substantial improvement over those generated using the static MALR. These findings suggest that lower near-surface temperature lapse rates can be expected under a warming climate and that the air temperature near the glacier surface is less sensitive to changes in the temperature of the free atmosphere than is generally assumed.},

abstract = {The surface characteristics of different carbon materials: activated carbon, carbon felt, glassy carbon and a porous carbon monolith were investigated. The specific surface area was examined by the BET method with N-2 adsorption, the amount and the type of surface oxygen groups by Boehm titration as well as by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). By comparing the results obtained using BET analysis with those of TPD and the Boehm method, it was found that the number of surface groups was not proportional to the specific surface area. The total amount of oxygen groups, obtained by TPD, is higher than the amount obtained by Boehm's method for porous samples. The inconsistencies between these results originate from the fact that the Boehm method is limited to the determination of acidic and basic groups, whereas TPD provides information on the total number of all surface oxygen groups. In addition, the presence of porosity could reduce the solvent-accessible surface in the Boehm method. The TPD profiles of CO evolution showed the presence of a low temperature maximum, below 650 K, which originates from CO2 reduction on the carbon material surface.},

abstract = {Thermal activity monitoring in and around active volcanic areas using remote sensing is an essential part of volcanology nowadays. Three identical approaches were used for thermal activity exploration at Aso volcanic area in Japan using Landsat ETM+images. First, the conventional methods for hydrothermal alteration mapping were applied to find the most active thermal region after exploring geothermal indicator minerals. Second, we found some thermally highly anomalous regions around Nakadake crater using land surface temperature estimation. Then, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation was used for estimating and also monitoring radiative heat flux (RHF) from the most active region of about 8km2 in and around Nakadake crater in the central part of the Aso volcano. To fulfill the required parameter in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux, the NDVI (Normalized differential vegetation index) method was used for spectral emissivity, and the mono-window algorithm was used for land surface temperature of this study area. The NDVI value was used to divide land-cover in the study area into four types: water, bare ground, mixed and vegetated land. The bare land was found within the most active region. Vegetation coverage area showed an inverse relationship with total RHF in this study as health of thermally stressed vegetation supports this relationship. The spatial distribution of spectral emissivity ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 in our study. Land surface temperature was estimated using a mono-window algorithm and was highest LST in 2008 and lowest in 2011. The results of RHF showed that the highest pixel RHF was found to be about 296W/m2 in 2008. Total RHF was obtained of about 607MW in 2002 and the lowest was about 354MW in 2008. The RHF anomaly area was found the highest in 2002 and was lowest in 2011. The highest total heat discharge rate (HDR) obtained about 3918MW in 2002 and lowest total HDR about 2289MW in 2008 from this study area. But in the case of Nakadake crater alone, the higher thermal activity was observed in 2008 and was less in 2004. The study showed that Landsat thermal infrared is the best option for thermal activity exploration and monitoring at Aso volcano as well as in any active volcano region considering high efficiency and low cost.},

abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter in investigating environmental, ecological processes and climate change at various scales, and is also valuable in the studies of evapotranspiration, soil moisture conditions, surface energy balance, and urban heat islands. These studies require thermal infrared (TIR) images at both high temporal and spatial resolution to retrieve LST. However, currently, no single satellite sensors can deliver TIR data at both high temporal and spatial resolution. Thus, various algorithms/models have been developed to enhance the spatial or the temporal resolution of TIR data, but rare of those can enhance both spatial and temporal details. This paper presents a new data fusion algorithm for producing Landsat-like LST data by blending daily MODIS and periodic Landsat TM datasets. The original Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) was improved and modified for predicting thermal radiance and LST data by considering annual temperature cycle (ATC) and urban thermal landscape heterogeneity. The technique of linear spectral mixture analysis was employed to relate the Landsat radiance with the MODIS one, so that the temporal changes in radiance can be incorporated in the fusion model. This paper details the theoretical basis and the implementation procedures of the proposed data fusion algorithm, Spatio-temporal Adaptive Data Fusion Algorithm for Temperature mapping (SADFAT). A case study was conducted that predicted LSTs of five dates in 2005 from July to October in Los Angeles County, California. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy for the whole study area ranged from 1.3. K to 2. K. Like existing spatio-temporal data fusion models, the SADFAT method has a limitation in predicting LST changes that were not recorded in the MODIS and/or Landsat pixels due to the model assumption. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Arctic is among the regions with the most rapid changes in climate and has the expected highest increase in temperature. Changes in the timing of phenological phases, such as onset of the growing season observed from remote sensing, are among the most sensitive bio-indicators of climate change. The study area here is the High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, located between 76°30ʹ and 80°50ʹN. The goal of this study was to use MODIS Terra data (the MOD09Q1 and MOD09A1 surface reflectance products, both with 8-day temporal composites) to map the onset of the growing season on Svalbard for the 2000–2013 period interpreted from field observations. Due to a short and intense period with greening-up and frequent cloud cover, all the cloud free data is needed, which requires reliable cloud masks. We used a combination of three cloud removing methods (State QA values, own algorithms, and manual removal). This worked well, but is time-consuming as it requires manual interpretation of cloud cover. The onset of the growing season was then mapped by a NDVI threshold method, which showed high correlation (r2 = 0.60, n = 25, p \&lt; 0.001) with field observations of flowering of Salix polaris (polar willow). However, large bias was found between NDVI-based mapped onset and field observations in bryophyte-dominated areas, which indicates that the results in these parts must be interpreted with care. On average for the 14-year period, the onset of the growing season occurs after July 1st in 68.4\% of the vegetated areas of Svalbard. The mapping revealed large variability between years. The years 2000 and 2008 were extreme in terms of late onset of the growing season, and 2002 and 2013 had early onset. Overall, no clear trend in onset of the growing season for the 2000–2013 period was found.},

abstract = {The influence of trends in sea ice concentration (SIC) and cloud cover on trends in surface temperature over the Arctic Ocean from 1982 to 2004 is investigated analytically, and evaluated empirically with satellite products. The results demonstrate that changes in SIC and cloud cover played major roles in the magnitude of recent Arctic surface temperature trends. Significant surface warming associated with sea ice loss, over 0.9 K decade\&\#8722;1, is found over the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in autumn, accounting for most of the observed 1.1 K decade\&\#8722;1 warming trend. If the mean SIC over the Arctic Ocean in each season is reduced by half, our analysis shows that the surface temperature will increase by approximately 10 K in winter and 6 K in spring and autumn. In winter, surface temperature trends associated with changes in cloud cover are negative over most of the Arctic Ocean, and with cloud cover trends explaining \&\#8722;0.91 out of \&\#8722;1.2 K decade\&\#8722;1 of the surface temperature cooling. In spring, 0.55 K decade\&\#8722;1 of the total 1.0 K decade\&\#8722;1 warming can be attributed to the trend associated with cloud cover changes. After eliminating the effects of changes in SIC and cloud cover on surface temperature trends, the residual surface temperature trends can be used in a more robust diagnosis of surface warming or cooling in the Arctic. The same procedure can be applied to study the impact of changes in sea ice thickness, ocean inflow, and other parameters on the temperature trends, and to completely different sets of climate variables, whether they are measured or modeled.},

abstract = {In order to develop efficient strategies for risk mitigation and emergency management, planners require the assessment of both the expected hazard (frequency and magnitude) and the vulnerability of exposed elements. This paper presents a GIS-based methodology to produce qualitative to semi-qualitative thematic risk assessments for tephra fallout around explosive volcanoes, designed to operate with datasets of variable precision and resolution depending on data availability. Due to the constant increase in population density around volcanoes and to the wide dispersal of tephra from volcanic plumes, a large range of threats, such as roof collapses, damage to crops, blockage of vital lifelines and health problems, concern even remote communities. To address these issues, we have assessed the vulnerability and the risk levels for five themes relevant to tephra fallout: (1) social, (2) economic, (3) environmental, (4) physical and (5) territorial. Risk and vulnerability indices for each theme are averaged to the fourth level of administrative unit (parroquia, parish). In a companion paper, Biass and Bonadonna (this volume) present a probabilistic hazard assessment for tephra fallout at Cotopaxi volcano (Ecuador) using the advection-diffusion model TEPHRA2, which is based on field investigations and a global eruption database (Global Volcanism Program, GVP). The scope of this paper is to present a new approach to risk assessment specifically designed for tephra fallout, based on a comprehensive hazard assessment of Cotopaxi volcano. Our results show that an eruption of moderate magnitude (i.e. VEI 4) would result in the possible collapse of *9,000 houses in the two parishes located close to the volcano. Our study also reveals a high risk on agriculture, closely linked to the economic sector, and a possible accessibility problem in case of an eruption of any size, as tephra is likely to affect the only major road running from Quito to Latacunga (Panamerican Highway). As a result, this method fits into the ongoing effort to better characterize and evaluate volcanic risk, and more specifically the risk associated with tephra fallout. Although this methodology relies on some assumptions, it can serve as a rapid and efficient starting point for further investigations of the risk level around explosive volcanoes.},

Because of the different response of the Planck function at different wavelengths, the radiant temperatures measured in two channels may be expressed in terms of contributions from two temperature fields, each occupying a portion of the pixel, where the portions are not necessarily contiguous. The resulting simultaneous nonlinear equations may be solved for the complimentary portions of the pixel occupied and one unknown temperature. In two adjacent pixels which can be assumed to have the same target temperatures and same background temperatures, both unknown temperatures may be found.},

abstract = {The typically sparse distribution of weather stations in mountainous terrain inadequately resolves temperature variability. Accordingly, high-resolution gridding of climate data (for applications such as hydrological modeling) often relies on assumptions such as a constant surface temperature lapse rate (i.e., decrease of surface temperature with altitude) of 6.5 degrees C km(-1). Using an example of the Cascade Mountains, we describe the temporal and spatial variability of the surface temperature lapse rate, combining data from: (1) COOP stations, (2) nearby radiosonde launches, (3) a temporary dense network of sensors, (4) forecasts from the MM5 regional model, and (5) PRISM geo-statistical analyses. On the windward side of the range, the various data sources reveal annual mean lapse rates of 3.9-5.2 degrees C km(-1), substantially smaller than the often-assumed 6.5 degrees C km(-1). The data sets show similar seasonal and diurnal variability, with lapse rates smallest (2.5-3.5 degrees C km(-1)) in late-summer minimum temperatures, and largest (6.5-7.5 degrees C km(-1)) in spring maximum temperatures. Geographic (windward versus lee side) differences in lapse rates are found to be substantial. Using a simple runoff model, we show the appreciable implications of these results for hydrological modeling.},

abstract = { Global sea ice products are produced from the Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard both the Terra and Aqua satellites. Daily sea ice extent and ice surface temperature (IST) products are available at 1- and 4-km resolution. Validation activities during the "cold period" (when meltwater is generally not present) in the Northern Hemisphere, defined here as October through May, have been undertaken to assess the accuracy of the 1-km resolution MODIS IST algorithm and product. Validation was also done at the South Pole station in Antarctica. In the Arctic Ocean, near-surface air temperatures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) Alaska tide stations and from drifting buoys from the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) buoy program were compared with MODIS-derived ISTs. Using the standard MODIS sea ice product, which utilizes the MODIS cloud mask, results show a bias (mean error) of -2.1 K and a root mean square (RMS) error of 3.7 K. The negative bias means that the satellite retrieval is less than the air temperature. With the bias removed, the RMS error is 3.0 K. When additional visual cloud screening is performed to eliminate MODIS pixels thought to be contaminated by fog, results improved, with a subset of the larger dataset showing a bias of -0.9 K and an RMS error of 1.6 K. Uncertainties would be reduced in the Arctic Ocean dataset if the skin temperature of the sea ice were reported instead of the near-surface air temperatures. With the bias removed, the RMS error for the Arctic Ocean dataset is 1.3 K. Results from the South Pole station in Antarctica show that under clear skies as determined using lidar measurements, the MODIS ISTs are also very close to those of the near-surface air temperatures with a bias of -1.2 K and an RMS error of 1.7 K. With the bias removed, the RMS error for the South Pole dataset is 1.2 K. Thus, the accuracy (RMS error) of the IST measurement is 1.2-1.3 K. It is not possible to obtain an accurate IST from MODIS in the presence of even very thin clouds or fog, and this is the main limitation of the MODIS ice surface temperature product. MODIS sea ic-

The approach related multi-temporal WELD metrics and expert-derived training data for forest cover loss and bare ground gain through a decision tree classification algorithm. Forest cover loss was reported at state and ecoregional scales, and the identification of core forests' absent of change was made and verified using LiDAR data from the GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimetry System) instrument. Bare ground gain correlated with population change for large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) outside of desert or semi-desert environments. GoogleEarth??? time-series images were used to validate the products. Mapped forest cover loss totaled 53,084km2 and was found to be depicted conservatively, with a user's accuracy of 78\% and a producer's accuracy of 68\%. Excluding errors of adjacency, user's and producer's accuracies rose to 93\% and 89\%, respectively. Mapped bare ground gain equaled 5974km2 and nearly matched the estimated area from the reference (GoogleEarth???) classification; however, user's (42\%) and producer's (49\%) accuracies were much less than those of the forest cover loss product. Excluding errors of adjacency, user's and producer's accuracies rose to 62\% and 75\%, respectively. Compared to recent 2001-2006 USGS National Land Cover Database validation data for forest loss (82\% and 30\% for respective user's and producer's accuracies) and urban gain (72\% and 18\% for respective user's and producer's accuracies), results using a single CONUS-scale model with WELD data are promising and point to the potential for national-scale operational mapping of key land cover transitions. However, validation results highlighted limitations, some of which can be addressed by improving training data, creating a more robust image feature space, adding contemporaneous Landsat 5 data to the inputs, and modifying definition sets to account for differences in temporal and spatial observational scales. The presented land cover extent and change data are available via the official WELD website (ftp://weldftp.cr.usgs.gov/CONUS\_5Y\_LandCover/ftp://weldftp.cr.usgs.gov/CONUS\_5Y\_LandCover/). ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Landsat-8 satellite of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in April 2013. Just weeks after it entered active service, its sensors observed activity at Paluweh Volcano, Indonesia. Given that the image acquired was in the daytime, its shortwave infrared observations were contaminated with reflected solar radiation; however, those of the satellite’s Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) show thermal emission from the volcano’s summit and flanks. These emissions detected in sensor’s band 10 (10.60–11.19 µm) have here been quantified in terms of radiant power, to confirm reports of the actual volcanic processes operating at the time of image acquisition, and to form an initial assessment of the TIRS in its volcanic observation capabilities. Data from band 11 have been neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable at the time of writing. At the instant of image acquisition, the thermal emission of the volcano was found to be 345 MW. This value is shown to be on the same order of magnitude as similarly timed NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer thermal observations. Given its unique characteristics, the TIRS shows much potential for providing useful, detailed and accurate volcanic observations in the future.},

abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an important technique in the exploration of geothermal resources. In this study, a geothermal survey is conducted in Tengchong area of Yunnan province in China using TIR data from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor. Based on radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and emissivity calculation, a simple but efficient single channel algorithm with acceptable precision is applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of study area. The LST anomalous areas with temperature about 4-10 K higher than background area are discovered. Four geothermal areas are identified with the discussion of geothermal mechanism and the further analysis of regional geologic structure. The research reveals that the distribution of geothermal areas is consistent with the fault development in study area. Magmatism contributes abundant thermal source to study area and the faults provide thermal channels for heat transfer from interior earth to land surface and facilitate the present of geothermal anomalies. Finally, we conclude that TIR remote sensing is a cost-effective technique to detect LST anomalies. Combining TIR remote sensing with geological analysis and the understanding of geothermal mechanism is an accurate and efficient approach to geothermal area detection. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In remote sensing studies of land surface temperatures (LST), thematic land-use and land-cover (LULC) data are frequently employed for simple correlation analyses between LULC types and their thermal signatures. Development of quantitative surface descriptors could improve our capabilities for modeling urban thermal landscapes and advance urban climate research. This study developed an analytical procedure based upon a spectral unmixing model for characterizing and quantifying the urban landscape in Indianapolis, Indiana. A Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus image of the study area, acquired on 22 June 2002, was spectrally unmixed into four fraction endmembers, namely, green vegetation, soil, high and low albedo. Impervious surface was then computed from the high and low albedo images. A hybrid classification procedure was developed to classify the fraction images into seven land-use and land-cover classes. Next, pixel-based LST measurements were related to urban surface biophysical descriptors derived from spectral mixture analysis (SMA). Correlation analyses were conducted to investigate land-cover based relationships between LST and impervious surface and green vegetation fractions for an analysis of the causes of LST variations. Results indicate that fraction images derived from SMA were effective for quantifying the urban morphology and for providing reliable measurements of biophysical variables such as vegetation abundance, soil, and impervious surface. An examination of LST variations within census block groups and their relationships with the compositions of LULC types, biophysical descriptors, and other relevant spatial data shows that LST possessed a weaker relation with the LULC compositions than with other variables (including urban biophysical descriptors, remote sensing biophysical variables, GIS-based impervious surface variables, and population density). Further research should be directed to refine spectral mixture modeling. The use of multi-temporal remote sensing data for urban time-space modeling and comparison of urban morphology in different geographical settings are also feasible.},

Results for three different land-use areas in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, show significant differences exist between the complete, nadir, and off-nadir airborne estimates of urban surface temperature during daytime. For the sites and times studied, the complete surface temperature is shown to agree with airborne off-nadir estimates of the apparent surface temperature of the most shaded walls. Some implications of using the complete surface temperature to estimate screen level air temperature and to calculate surface sensible heat flux are given.},

abstract = {Landsat satellite data has become ubiquitous in regional-scale forest disturbance detection. The Tasseled Cap (TC) transformation for Landsat data has been used in several disturbance-mapping projects because of its ability to highlight relevant vegetation changes. We used an automated composite analysis procedure to test four multi-date variants of the TC transformation (called "data structures" here) in their ability to facilitate identification of stand-replacing disturbance. Data structures tested included one with all three TC indices (brightness, greenness, wetness), one with just brightness and greenness, one with just wetness, and one called the Disturbance Index (DI) which is a novel combination of the three TC indices. Data structures were tested in the St. Petersburg region of Russia and in two ecologically distinct regions of Washington State in the US. In almost all cases, the TC variants produced more accurate change classifications than multi-date stacks of the original Landsat reflectance data. In general, there was little overall difference between the TC-derived data structures. However, DI performed better than the others at the Russian study area, where slower succession rates likely produce the most durable disturbance signal. Also, at the highly productive western Washington site, where the disturbance signal is likely the most ephemeral, DI and wetness performed worse than the larger data structures when a longer monitoring interval was used (eight years between image acquisitions instead of four). This suggests that both local forest recovery rates and the re-sampling interval should be considered in choosing a Landsat transformation for use in stand-replacing disturbance detection. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The disintegration of ice shelves, reduced sea-ice and glacier extent, and shifting ecological zones observed around Antarctica highlight the impact of recent atmospheric and oceanic warming on the cryosphere. Observations and models suggest that oceanic and atmospheric temperature variations at Antarctica's margins affect global cryosphere stability, ocean circulation, sea levels and carbon cycling. In particular, recent climate changes on the Antarctic Peninsula have been dramatic, yet the Holocene climate variability of this region is largely unknown, limiting our ability to evaluate ongoing changes within the context of historical variability and underlying forcing mechanisms. Here we show that surface ocean temperatures at the continental margin of the western Antarctic Peninsula cooled by 3-4 °C over the past 12,000 years, tracking the Holocene decline of local (65° S) spring insolation. Our results, based on TEX(86) sea surface temperature (SST) proxy evidence from a marine sediment core, indicate the importance of regional summer duration as a driver of Antarctic seasonal sea-ice fluctuations. On millennial timescales, abrupt SST fluctuations of 2-4 °C coincide with globally recognized climate variability. Similarities between our SSTs, Southern Hemisphere westerly wind reconstructions and El Ni\~{n}o/Southern Oscillation variability indicate that present climate teleconnections between the tropical Pacific Ocean and the western Antarctic Peninsula strengthened late in the Holocene epoch. We conclude that during the Holocene, Southern Ocean temperatures at the western Antarctic Peninsula margin were tied to changes in the position of the westerlies, which have a critical role in global carbon cycling.},

@article{Wang1999,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel method that allows the diurnal variation of ground heat flux to be computed from the corresponding time series measurement of surface soil temperature. Soil temperature and soil heat flux over time at one location are uniquely related through a half-order derivative/integral operator when heat transfer in a soil matrix is described by a one-dimensional diffusion equation with a constant diffusivity parameter. Both simulated and observed data have been used to test the method. The case study suggests that the derived relationships between soil heat flux and soil temperature under idealized conditions provide satisfactory approximations for practical purposes. Close agreement of the estimated variables with observations indicates that this proposed method is promising. Its potential applications include the estimation of the regional energy balance at the land surface using remote sensing observations.},

The study was based on nighttime images obtained from the Landsat Thematic Mapper and high-density meteorological data obtained from the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS). The correlation coefficients between the air temperatures and the surface temperatures at the AMeDAS stations were relatively high despite the simple comparison. Surface temperature alone explained 80\&\#37; of the observed variation in air temperature. The spatial scales of the effect of surface temperature on air temperature and the effect of vegetation density on air temperature were related to the mean lapse rate of the atmospheric boundary layer. Air temperature was more sensitive to vegetation density when the mean lapse rate of the atmospheric boundary layer was smaller. Accuracy in the estimation of air temperature from satellite-derived surface temperature data was improved by multiple regression using the spatially averaged surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index.},

abstract = {We describe the current GISS analysis of surface temperature change for the period 1880-1999 based primarily on meteorological station measurements. The global surface temperature in 1998 was the warmest in the period of instrumental data. The rate of temperature change was higher in the past 25 years than at any previous time in the period of instrumental data. The warmth of 1998 was too large and pervasive to be fully accounted for by the recent El Nine. Despite cooling in the first half of 1999, we suggest that the mean global temperature, averaged over 2-3 years, has moved to a higher level, analogous to the increase that occurred in the late 1970s. Warming in the United States over the past 50 years has been smaller than in most of the world, and over that period there was a slight cooling trend in the eastern United States and the neighboring Atlantic Ocean. The spatial and temporal patterns of the temperature change suggest that more than one mechanism was involved in this regional cooling. The cooling trend in the United States, which began after the 1930s and is associated with ocean temperature change patterns, began to reverse after 1979. We suggest that further warming in the United States to a level rivaling the 1930s is likely in the next decade, but reliable prediction requires better understanding of decadal oscillations of ocean temperature.},

abstract = {Temperature trend magnitudes at 71 homogenized surface stations with elevations above 2000 m asl in the eastern and central Tibetan Plateau (TP) and 56 grid points from surface NCEP and ERA-40 reanalyses in the TP's vicinity are examined. Both the surface meteorological stations and ERA-40 show general warming trends at the majority of locations, especially in winter. NCEP fails to identify this. Compared with the surface stations, both NCEP and ERA-40 reanalysis data underestimate air temperature trends in the TP, but ERA-40 is better than NCEP. There are no simple linear relationships between elevation and temperature trend magnitudes on an annual or seasonal basis in the surface data or ERA-40, and in NCEP this relationship is inconsistent. Instead there are significant correlations between mean annual and seasonal temperatures and temperature trend magnitudes in the surface dataset and NCEP data (but not ERA-40). We suggest this is due to cryospheric feedback since trends are enhanced when mean annual temperatures are near freezing. The absence of any simple elevation dependency in temperature trends suggests that the rapid warming rate derived from high elevation ice-cores in this region should be interpreted with caution. In addition, more attention should be given to the selection of reanalysis to represent surface climate in the TP, since topographical differences between grid points and stations, and other reanalysis model differences such as surface land schemes, cause differences in trend identification and patterns in this critical region. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Landsat imagery from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors was used to examine change trajectories for terrestrial emittance among spatial groupings from 1986 to 2007. Trajectories of locations with known change events were also examined. Relationships between the spatial groupings and several change vectors (distance to geologic faults, distance to large water bodies, and distance to earthquake swarms) were explored. The analysis showed the stron- gest relationship between absolute difference in terrestrial emittance and earthquake swarms, with 34\% of the variation explained. Certain known change events were reflected in the change trajectories, while the Landsat imagery was not able to detect other known events. This suggests that Landsat imagery might be a useful tool for monitoring geothermal responses in YNP, but cannot be expected to suffice as the sole monitoring tool.},

abstract = {A sequence of five high-resolution satellite-based land surface temperature (Ts) images over a watershed area in Iowa were analyzed. As a part of the SMEX02 field experiment, these land surface temperature images were extracted from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) thermal bands. The radiative transfer model MODTRAN 4.1 was used with atmospheric profile data to atmospherically correct the Landsat data. NDVI derived from Landsat visible and near-infrared bands was used to estimate fractional vegetation cover, which in turn was used to estimate emissivity for Landsat thermal bands. The estimated brightness temperature was compared with concurrent tower based measurements. The mean absolute difference (MAD) between the satellite-based brightness temperature estimates and the tower based brightness temperature was 0.98°C for Landsat 7 and 1.47°C for Landsat 5, respectively. Based on these images, the land surface temperature spatial variation and its change with scale are addressed. The scaling properties of the surface temperature are important as they have significant implications for changes in land surface flux estimation between higher-resolution Landsat and regional to global sensors such as MODIS.},

Data collected during the semi-arid-land-surface-atmosphere program (SALSA) over a semi-arid grassland in Mexico were used to assess the performance of the approach. The results showed that this approach led to reasonable estimates of the observed fluxes. The mean average percentage difference (MAPD) between observed and simulated fluxes was about 23\%, which is not statistically different from the expected 20\% scatter, when different flux measuring devices are compared over the same site. However, the sensitivity analysis indicated that the approach was rather sensitive to uncertainties in both measured radiative temperatures and aerodynamic characteristics of the vegetation. Finally, the issue of using dual angle observations of surface temperature for characterizing the difference between aerodynamic and nadir viewing radiative temperature has been examined. The results showed that this difference is linearly correlated with the difference between nadir and oblique radiative temperatures. Based on this finding, we expressed sensible heat flux in terms of the (nadir) radiative-air temperature gradient and a corrective term involving the nadir-oblique temperature differences. This formulation has been successfully tested. The resulting MAPD was about 33\%. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The pattern of borehole ground surface temperature (GST) reconstructions displays prominent discrepancies with instrumental surface air temperature (SAT) estimates during the 20th century, suggesting the presence of a considerable amount of noise and/or bias in any underlying spatial SAT signal. The vast majority of variance in the borehole dataset is efficiently retained by its two leading eigenvectors. A sizable share of the variance in the first eigenvector appears to be associated with non-SAT related bias in the borehole data. A weak but detectable SAT signal appears to be described by a combination of the first two eigenvectors. Exploiting this eigendecomposition, application of optimal signal estimation methods yields a hemispheric borehole SAT reconstruction that is largely consistent with instrumental data available in past centuries, and is indistinguishable in it smajor features from several published long-term temperature estimates based on both climate proxy data and model simulations.},

abstract = {Surface reflectance adjusted for atmospheric effects is a primary input for land cover change detection and for developing many higher level surface geophysical parameters. With the development of automated atmospheric correction algorithms, it is now feasible to produce large quantities of surface reflectance products using Landsat images. Validation of these products requires in situ measurements, which either do not exist or are difficult to obtain for most Landsat images. The surface reflectance products derived using data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), however, have been validated more comprehensively. Because the MODIS on the Terra platform and the Landsat 7 are only half an hour apart following the same orbit, and each of the 6 Landsat spectral bands overlaps with a MODIS band, good agreements between MODIS and Landsat surface reflectance values can be considered indicators of the reliability of the Landsat products, while disagreements may suggest potential quality problems that need to be further investigated. Here we develop a system called Landsat–MODIS Consistency Checking System (LMCCS). This system automatically matches Landsat data with MODIS observations acquired on the same date over the same locations and uses them to calculate a set of agreement metrics. To maximize its portability, Java and open-source libraries were used in developing this system, and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles were followed to make it more flexible for future expansion. As a highly automated system designed to run as a stand-alone package or as a component of other Landsat data processing systems, this system can be used to assess the quality of essentially every Landsat surface reflectance image where spatially and temporally matching MODIS data are available. The effectiveness of this system was demonstrated using it to assess preliminary surface reflectance products derived using the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat images for the 2000 epoch. As surface reflectance likely will be a standard product for future Landsat missions, the approach developed in this study can be adapted as an operational quality assessment system for those missions.},

abstract = {Support vector machines (SVM) has been recently used with success for the classification of hyperspectral images. This method appears to be a robust alternative for pattern recognition with hyperspectral data: since the method is based on a geometric point of view, no statistical estimation has to be achieved. Then, SVM outperforms classical supervised classification algorithms such as the maximum likelihood when the number of spectral bands increases or when the number of training samples remains limited. Nevertheless, those kernel-based methods do not take into consideration the spectral similarity between support vectors. Then, some modified kernels are presented to take into consideration the spectral similarity between support vectors to outperform SVM-based classification of hyperspectral data cube. Those kernels (that still suit Mercer's conditions) are based on the use of spectral angle to evaluate the distance between support vectors. Classifiers to compare have been applied to an image from the CASI sensor including 17 bands from 450 to 950nm representing an intensive agricultural region (Brittany, France). It appears that those kernels reduce false alarms that were induced by illumination effects with classical kernels.},

abstract = {Landsat-8, the latest in the Landsat series of satellites, was launched on February 11, 2013 and carries on board the Operational Land Imager (OLI) as one of its payloads. The satellite’s mission is to continue the long history of moderate resolution imaging of the Landsat program. The OLI follows the highly successful Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 in continuing to populate a global archive of Earth images that dates back to 1972. The design of the Landsat-8 instruments is a significant departure from earlier Landsats. The OLI is a pushbroom instrument; all previous recent Landsat instruments were electromechanical (whiskbroom) instruments. OLI also has two new spectral bands and refined bandpasses; the thermal imaging capability on Landsat-8 is in a separate instrument. The pushbroom design provides significantly better signal to noise performance than historically available, but at the expense of circa 70,000 detectors versus the 100 or so on previous instruments. The large focal plane and large number of detectors makes detector to detector relative calibration more challenging, increasing the propensity for banding and striping in imagery. On-board radiometric calibration devices include a shutter to measure the dark levels, a full aperture solar panel for calibration against the sun, and multiple sets of lamps for short-term stability monitoring. Early results from the on-board calibration devices indicate that the OLI is outperforming the Landsat-7 instrument in signal-to-noise ratio by an order of magnitude, consistent with pre-launch measurements. Over the first five months, the instrument is stable to within 0.7\%, as measured by the lamps and solar diffuser. A relative calibration (detector-to-detector) and a linearization parameter update have been performed that reduce visible striping; with this update, the residual striping has been reduced by half in all OLI bands.},

abstract = {Soil temperature is a variable that links surface structure to soil processes and yet its spatial prediction across landscapes with variable surface structure is poorly understood. In this study, a hybrid soil temperature model was developed to predict daily spatial patterns of soil temperature in a forested landscape by incorporating the effects of topography, canopy and ground litter. The model is based on both heat transfer physics and empirical relationship between air and soil temperature, and uses input variables that are extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM), satellite imagery, and standard weather records. Model-predicted soil temperatures fitted well with data measured at 10 cm soil depth at three sites: two hardwood forests and a bare soil area. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model was highly sensitive to leaf area index (LAI) and air temperature. When the spatial pattern of soil temperature in a forested watershed was simulated by the model, different responses of bare and canopy-closed ground to air temperature were identified. Spatial distribution of daily air temperature was geostatistically interpolated from the data of weather stations adjacent to the simulated area. Spatial distribution of LAI was obtained from Landsat Thematic Mapper images. The hybrid model describes spatial variability of soil temperature across landscapes and different sensitivity to rising air temperature depending on site-specific surface structures such as LAI and ground litter stores. In addition, the model may be beneficially incorporated into other ecosystem models requiring soil temperature as one of the input variables. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The co-variability of monthly mean surface temperature and precipitation is determined globally for 1979–2002 from observationally-based analyses (ERA-40) for surface air temperature and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) version 2 for precipitation and compared with results from the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model version 3 (CAM3) and Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3). Results are combined for the 5 months for northern winter (November to March) and summer (May to September). Over land, negative correlations dominate, as dry conditions favor more sunshine and less evaporative cooling, while wet summers are cool. At high latitudes in winter, positive correlations dominate as warm moist advection in extratropical cyclones favors precipitation and the water holding capacity of the atmosphere limits precipitation amounts in cold conditions. Where ocean conditions drive the atmosphere, higher surface air temperatures are associated with precipitation, as in El Ni\~{n}o, but some areas, such as the western Pacific in northern summer, feature negative correlations indicating that the atmosphere determines the surface temperatures. In the CAM driven with observed sea surface temperatures and the CCSM in fully coupled mode the latter mechanism is largely absent, and correlations are generally much stronger than observed, indicating more local control. Neither temperature nor precipitation records should be interpreted without considering the strong covariability that exists.},

abstract = {There are a number of inconsistencies in the measured values reported for the burning surface temperatures of ammonium perchlorate (AP). Therefore, the temperature profile near the burning surface of pure AP was measured using microthermocouples. A pressed AP specimen was burned using a propane/air diffusion flame or by increasing initial temperature below the pressure deflagration limit of AP. Since a small cavity may exist around the thermocouple, a large AP crystal was grown around the thermocouple bead, and it was also used in the temperature measurement of the burning surface. A video recording of the AP surface was also made using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera during the combustion process. The time on videotape was synchronized with that on the record of the thermocouple measurements using a flash lamp. As a result, the time at which the thermocouple bead appeared on the burning surface was precisely identified on a temperature-time diagram, and the burning surface temperature was obtained. It was found that the surface temperature of pure AP is in the range of 450-480 ??C, and it was ascertained that the burning surface temperature is independent of the regression rate and the heating rate of the AP specimen. On the other hand, the surface temperature does depend on pressure. The slope of the logarithmic pressure versus reciprocal surface temperature was 130-160 kJ/mol. This value is slightly higher than one-half of the heat of dissociation for AP. Our results were similar to results obtained by Powling et al. with an infrared-radiation technique. However, these results are different from those measured by thermocouples in several other studies. These differences may actually reflect differences in the methods used to identify the burning surface in the measured temperature data.},

abstract = {Urban environmental conditions are strongly dependent on the biophysical properties and radiant thermal field of the land cover elements in the urban mosaic. Observations of urban reflectance and surface temperature provide valuable constraints on the physical properties that are determinants of mass and energy fluxes in the urban environment. Consistencies in the covariation of surface temperature with reflectance properties can be parameterized to represent characteristics of the surface energy flux associated with different land covers and physical conditions. Linear mixture models can accurately represent Landsat ETM+ reflectances as fractions of generic spectral endmembers that correspond to land surface materials with distinct physical properties. Modeling heterogeneous land cover as mixtures of rock and/or soil Substrate, Vegetation and non-reflective Dark surface (SVD) generic endmembers makes it possible to quantify the dependence of aggregate surface temperature on the relative abundance of each physical component of the land cover, thereby distinguishing the effects of vegetation abundance, soil exposure, albedo and shadowing. Comparing these covariations in a wide variety of urban settings and physical environments provides a more robust indication of the global variability in these parameter spaces than could be inferred from a single study area. A comparative analysis of 24 urban areas and their non-urban peripheries illustrates the variability in the urban thermal fields and its dependence on biophysical land surface components. Contrary to expectation, moderate resolution intra-urban variations in surface temperature are generally as large as regional surface heat island signatures in these urban areas. Many of the non-temperate urban areas did not have surface heat island signatures at all. However, the multivariate distributions of surface temperature and generic endmember fractions reveal consistent patterns of thermal fraction covariation resulting from land cover characteristics. The Thermal-Vegetation (TV) fraction space illustrates the considerable variability in the well-known inverse correlation between surface temperature and vegetation fraction at moderate (< 100??m) spatial resolutions. The Thermal-Substrate (TS) fraction space reveals energetic thresholds where competing effects of albedo, illumination and soil moisture determine the covariation of maximum and minimum temperature with illuminated substrate fraction. The dark surface endmember fraction represents a fundamental ambiguity in the radiance signal because it can correspond to either absorptive (e.g. low albedo asphalt), transmissive (e.g. deep clear water) or shadowed (e.g. tree canopy shadow) surfaces. However, in areas where dark surface composition can be inferred from spatial context, the different responses of these surfaces may still allow them to be distinguished in the thermal fraction space. ?? 2006.},

K (within ±. 1. K in most cases) for all the sites but six bare soil sites. The V5 LSTs are underestimated by more than 2. K and up to 4.5. K at the desert site near In-salah, Algeria. Three refinements were implemented in the V6.3.0 daily LST Product Generation Executive (PGE)16 code: 1) refine the original viewing angle dependent split-window algorithm by adding two sets of coefficients separately for retrieval of daytime and nighttime LSTs at bare soil pixels in the hot and warm bare soil zone (HAWBSZ) within latitude range from 38° to 49.5°, 2) adjust the emissivity difference in bands 31 and 32 for bare soil pixels in HAWBSZ, and 3) incorporate the new refined split-window algorithm into the day/night algorithm for retrieving surface emissivity and temperature values at 6. km grids in HAWBSZ. The V6.3.0 PGE16 code was tested with C6 Aqua and Terra MODIS input data over a period of one year or longer in selected tile regions. The resulting C6 level-2 LST products were evaluated at five bare soil sites in north Africa, where radiosonde observation data for atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles are available, with 12 R-based validation data sets as follows: the mean LST error is within ±. 0.6. K in 10 validate data sets, 0.8. K in one data set (for daytime LSTs at SVU site) and 1.9. K in another set (for daytime LSTs at Farafra site). The standard deviation of the C6 LST validation errors is less than 0.5. K in all the 12 validation data sets but the data set for daytime LSTs at Farafra site at 0.7. K. Statistical and viewing angle dependence analyses of the retrieved surface emissivity values also indicate that the C6 level-3 LST products are much better than the previous C4.1 and C5 products. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The appraisal of crop water requirements (CWR) is crucial for the management of water resources, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where irrigation represents the largest consumer of water, such as the Doukkala area, western Morocco. Simple and (semi) empirical approaches have been applied to estimate CWR: the first one is called Kc-NDVI method, based on the correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the crop coefficient (Kc); the second one is the analytical approach based on the direct application of the Penman-Monteith equation with reflectance-based estimates of canopy biophysical variables, such as surface albedo (r), leaf area index (LAI) and crop height (hc). A time series of high spatial resolution RapidEye (REIS), SPOT4 (HRVIR1) and Landsat 8 (OLI) images acquired during the 2012/2013 agricultural season has been used to assess the spatial and temporal variability of crop evapotranspiration ETc and biophysical variables. The validation using the dual crop coefficient approach (Kcb) showed that the satellite-based estimates of daily ETc were in good agreement with ground-based ETc, i.e., R2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 0.79 versus R2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 0.89 for the Kc-NDVI, respective of the analytical approach. The assessment of irrigation performance in terms of adequacy between water requirements and allocations showed that CWR were much larger than allocated surface water for the entire area, with this difference being small at the beginning of the growing season. Even smaller differences were observed between surface water allocations and Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) throughout the irrigation season. Finally, surface water allocations were rather close to Net Irrigation Water Requirements (NIWR).},

A statistical Landsat metadata analysis is reported considering more than 800,000 Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM. + acquisitions obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center archive. The global monthly probabilities of acquiring a cloud-free land surface observation for December 1998 to November 2001 (2000 epoch) and from December 2008 to November 2011 (2010 epoch) are reported to assess the availability of the Landsat data in the USGS Landsat archive for global multi-temporal land remote sensing applications. The global probabilities of acquiring a cloud-free land surface observation in each of three different seasons with the highest seasonal probabilities of cloud-free land surface observation are reported, considering one, two and three years of Landsat data, to assess the availability of Landsat data for global land cover mapping. The probabilities are derived considering Landsat 5 TM only, Landsat 7 ETM. + only, and both sensors combined, to examine the relative benefits of using one or both Landsat sensors. The results demonstrate the utility of combing both Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM. + data streams to take advantage of their different acquisition patterns and to mitigate the deleterious impact of the Landsat 7 ETM. + 2003 scan line failure. Sensor combination provided a greater global acquisition coverage with a 1.7\% to 14.4\% higher percentage of land locations acquired monthly compared to considering Landsat 7 ETM. + data alone. The mean global monthly probability of a cloud-free land surface observation for the combined sensors was up to nearly 1.4 and 6.7 times greater than for ETM. + and TM alone respectively. The probability of acquiring a cloud-free Landsat land surface observation in different seasons was greater when more years of data were considered and when both Landsat sensor data were combined. Considering combined sensors and 36. months of data, 86.4\% and 84.2\% of the global land locations had probabilities ???0.95 for the 2000 and 2010 epochs respectively, with a global mean probability of 0.92 (?? 0.24) for the 2000 epoch and 0.90 (?? 0.28) for the 2010 epoch. These results indicate that 36. months of combined Landsat sensor data will provide sufficient land surface observations for 30. m global land cover mapping using a multi-temporal supervised classification scheme. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The temperature fields on the surface of MEA fixed inside a proton exchange membrane fuel cell with a serpentine channel flow bed were measured by infrared imaging technology under non-humidification conditions. The temperature distributions over the MEA surface under whole channel region were achieved. The experimental results show that the downstream temperatures are higher than the upstream. The hot region on the MEA surface is easy to locate from the infrared temperature image. The mean temperature on the MEA surface and the cell temperature both increase with the current density. Higher current density makes the non-uniformity of temperature distribution on the MEA surface worse. The loading time significantly affects the temperature distribution. Compared with the electrical performance of the cell, the MEA's temperatures need much more time to reach stable. The results indicate that isothermal assumption is not appropriate for a modeling of PEMFCs, and monitoring the temperature of external surface of the flow field plate or end plate cannot supply accurate reference to control the temperatures on MEA surface. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, our calculations show that the presence of surface states leads to a mixing of the dark and bright exciton states, resulting in a decrease of 3 orders of magnitude of the dark-exciton radiative lifetime. This result explains the persistence of the zero-phonon emission line at low temperature, for which thermal population of higher-energy bright-exciton states is negligible. Thus, we suggest that surface states are the controlling factor of dark-exciton radiative recombination in currently synthesized colloidal CdSe nanocrystals.},

A single nonlinear \&\#8220;global\&\#8221; surface water calibration of UK\&\#8242; 37 accurately predicts alkenone production temperatures over the diversity of modern-day oceanic environments and alkenone-synthesizing populations (T = \&\#8722;0.957 + 54.293(UK\&\#8242; 37) \&\#8722; 52.894(UK\&\#8242; 37)2 + 28.321(UK\&\#8242; 37)3, r2 = 0.97, n = 567). The mean standard error of estimation is 1.2°C with insignificant bias in estimated production temperature among the different ocean regions sampled. An exception to these trends is regions characterized by strong lateral advection and extreme productivity and temperature gradients (e.g., the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence). In contrast to the surface water data, the calibration of UK\&\#8242; 37 in surface sediments with overlying annual mean sea surface temperature (AnnO) is best fit by a linear model (AnnO = 29.876(UK\&\#8242; 37) \&\#8722; 1.334, r2 = 0.97, n = 592). The standard error of estimation (1.1°C) is similar to that of the surface water production calibration, but a higher degree of bias is observed among the regional data sets. The sediment calibration differs significantly from the surface water calibration. UK\&\#8242; 37 in surface sediments is consistently higher than that predicted from AnnO and the surface water production temperature calibration, and the magnitude of the offset increases as the surface water AnnO decreases. We apply the global production temperature calibration to the coretop UK\&\#8242; 37 data to estimate the coretop alkenone integrated production temperature (coretop IPT) and compare this with the overlying annual mean sea surface temperature (AnnO). We use simple models to explore the possible causes of the deviation observed between the coretop temperature signal, as estimated by UK\&\#8242; 37, and AnnO. Our results indicate that the deviation can best be explained if seasonality in production and/or thermocline production as well as differential degradation of 37:3 and 37:2 alkenones both affect the sedimentary alkenone signal.},

To evaluate the effects of the UV/O(3) surface treatment on the operation of bonded microfluidic devices, the relationship between UV/O(3) exposure and polymer hydrophilicity and surface chemistry are measured. Post-treatment surface chemistry is evaluated by XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis, and the stability of the treated surfaces following solvent exposure is reported.

In the frame of BIOSPEC (Linking spectral information at different spatial scales with biophysical parameters of Mediterranean vegetation in the context of global change) and FLUXPEC (Monitoring changes in water and carbon fluxes from remote and proximal sensing in Mediterranean “dehesa” ecosystem) projects LST retrieved from Landsat data is required to integrate ground-based observations of energy, water, and carbon fluxes with multi-scale remotely-sensed data and assess water and carbon balance in ecologically fragile heterogeneous ecosystem of Mediterranean wooded grassland (dehesa). Thus, three methods based on the Radiative Transfer Equation were used to extract LST from a series of 2009–2011 Landsat-5 TM images to assess the applicability for temperature input generation to a Landsat-MODIS LST integration. When compared to surface temperatures simulated using MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) with atmospheric profiles inputs (LSTref), values from Single-Channel (SC) algorithm are the closest (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.50 °C); procedure based on the online Radiative Transfer Equation Atmospheric Correction Parameters Calculator (RTE-ACPC) shows RMSD = 0.85 °C; Mono-Window algorithm (MW) presents the highest RMSD (2.34 °C) with systematical LST underestimation (bias = 1.81 °C). Differences between Landsat-retrieved LST and MODIS LST are in the range of 2 to 4 °C and can be explained mainly by differences in observation geometry, emissivity, and time mismatch between Landsat and MODIS overpasses. There is a seasonal bias in Landsat-MODIS LST differences due to greater variations in surface emissivity and thermal contrasts between landcover components.},

A Linear Spectral Mixture Model (\{LSMM\}) was applied to \{MODIS\} surface reflectance images to originate the burned areas maps, which were validated with \{TM\}/Landsat 5 and \{ETM\}+/Landsat 7 images and field data acquired in August 2013. The validation presented a correlation ranging from 67\% to 96\% with an average value of 86\%. The lower correlation values are related to the distinct spatial resolutions of the \{MODIS\} and \{TM\}/\{ETM\}+ sensors because small burn scars are not detected in \{MODIS\} images and higher spatial correlations are related to the presence of large fires, which are better identified in \{MODIS\}, increasing the accuracy of the mapping methodology. In addition, the 12-year burned area maps of Rond\^{o}nia indicate that fires, as a general pattern, occur in areas that have already been converted to some land use, such as vegetal extraction, large animal livestock areas or diversified permanent crops. Furthermore, during the analyzed period, land use conversion associated with climatic events significantly influenced the occurrence of fire in Rond\^{o}nia and amplified its impacts.},

abstract = {Previous laboratory and atmospheric experiments have shown that turbulence influences the surface temperature in a convective boundary layer. The main objective of this study is to examine land-atmosphere coupled heat transport mechanism for different stability conditions. High frequency infrared imagery and sonic anemometer measurements were obtained during the boundary layer late afternoon and sunset turbulence (BLLAST) experimental campaign. Temporal turbulence data in the surface-layer are then analyzed jointly with spatial surface-temperature imagery. The surface-temperature structures (identified using surface-temperature fluctuations) are strongly linked to atmospheric turbulence as manifested in several findings. The surface-temperature coherent structures move at an advection speed similar to the upper surface-layer or mixed-layer wind speed, with a decreasing trend with increase in stability. Also, with increasing instability the streamwise surface-temperature structure size decreases and the structures become more circular. The sequencing of surface- and air-temperature patterns is further examined through conditional averaging. Surface heating causes the initiation of warm ejection events followed by cold sweep events that result in surface cooling. The ejection events occur about 25 \% of the time, but account for 60-70 \% of the total sensible heat flux and cause fluctuations of up to 30 \% in the ground heat flux. Cross-correlation analysis between air and surface temperature confirms the validity of a scalar footprint model.},

The dynamic mechanism underlying Atlantic temperature variability is thought to be similar to that of the El Ni\~{n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the equatorial Pacific4,5, where air–sea coupling leads to a positive feedback between surface winds in the western basin, sea surface temperature in the eastern basin, and equatorial oceanic heat content. Here we use a suite of observational data, climate reanalysis products, and general circulation model simulations to reassess the factors driving the interannual variability. We show that some of the warm events can not be explained by previously identified equatorial wind stress forcing and ENSO-like dynamics. Instead, these events are driven by a mechanism in which surface wind forcing just north of the equator induces warm ocean temperature anomalies that are subsequently advected toward the equator. We find the surface wind patterns are associated with long- lived subtropical sea surface temperature anomalies and suggest they therefore reflect a link between equatorial and subtropicalAtlantic variability.},

abstract = {The twentieth-century trend in global-mean surface temperature was not monotonic: temperatures rose from the start of the century to the 1940s, fell slightly during the middle part of the century, and rose rapidly from the mid-1970s onwards. The warming-cooling-warming pattern of twentieth-century temperatures is typically interpreted as the superposition of long-term warming due to increasing greenhouse gases and either cooling due to a mid-twentieth century increase of sulphate aerosols in the troposphere, or changes in the climate of the world's oceans that evolve over decades (oscillatory multidecadal variability). Loadings of sulphate aerosol in the troposphere are thought to have had a particularly important role in the differences in temperature trends between the Northern and Southern hemispheres during the decades following the Second World War. Here we show that the hemispheric differences in temperature trends in the middle of the twentieth century stem largely from a rapid drop in Northern Hemisphere sea surface temperatures of about 0.3 °C between about 1968 and 1972. The timescale of the drop is shorter than that associated with either tropospheric aerosol loadings or previous characterizations of oscillatory multidecadal variability. The drop is evident in all available historical sea surface temperature data sets, is not traceable to changes in the attendant metadata, and is not linked to any known biases in surface temperature measurements. The drop is not concentrated in any discrete region of the Northern Hemisphere oceans, but its amplitude is largest over the northern North Atlantic.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is an important characteristic of the land surface. Because multi-spectral bands are used to describe the land surface, an approach has to be established to characterize the surface spatial heterogeneity from multi-spectral remote-sensing observations. This work aims at quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of cropland using varigorams for multi-temporal NDVI, near infrared (NIR) and red reflectance. A concept of mean length variability is proposed to compare the difference in spatial heterogeneity detected by variables with different magnitudes. The important temporal changes in spatial heterogeneity observed by NDVI, NIR and red bands over cropland are a result of changes in the fraction of vegetation cover. The results indicate the following: (1) the NIR and red variables detect a similar spatial heterogeneity of the cropland with similar values of the mean length variability before the sowing of crops; (2) the NDVI, NIR and red values capture different degrees of spatial heterogeneity when vegetation cover is low; (3) over medium vegetation cover, the NDVI and NIR values capture similar spatial heterogeneity, which is low compared to the red band due to the homogeneity of soil; and (4) the spatial heterogeneity quantified by the NIR value is more heterogeneous than those of the NDVI and red values when vegetation cover is high. The red reflectance is sensitive to soil properties while the NIR reflectance responds to vegetation. The spatial heterogeneity of red reflectance decreases and that of the NIR reflectance increases with the growth of vegetation. The NDVI value shows the greatest heterogeneity in the early stage of crop growth. With an increase in the image pixel size, the spatial heterogeneity quantified by the mean length variability of the NDVI, NIR and red variables tends to be the same. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The response of tropical cyclone activity to global warming is widely debated. It is often assumed that warmer sea surface temperatures provide a more favourable environment for the development and intensification of tropical cyclones, but cyclone genesis and intensity are also affected by the vertical thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere. Here we use climate models and observational reconstructions to explore the relationship between changes in sea surface temperature and tropical cyclone 'potential intensity'--a measure that provides an upper bound on cyclone intensity and can also reflect the likelihood of cyclone development. We find that changes in local sea surface temperature are inadequate for characterizing even the sign of changes in potential intensity, but that long-term changes in potential intensity are closely related to the regional structure of warming; regions that warm more than the tropical average are characterized by increased potential intensity, and vice versa. We use this relationship to reconstruct changes in potential intensity over the twentieth century from observational reconstructions of sea surface temperature. We find that, even though tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures are currently at a historical high, Atlantic potential intensity probably peaked in the 1930s and 1950s, and recent values are near the historical average. Our results indicate that--per unit local sea surface temperature change--the response of tropical cyclone activity to natural climate variations, which tend to involve localized changes in sea surface temperature, may be larger than the response to the more uniform patterns of greenhouse-gas-induced warming.},

abstract = {A method for the accurate determination of the melting temperature (Tm) of surface-immobilized DNA duplexes that exploits the fluorescence-quenching properties of gold is reported. A thiolated single-stranded DNA probe is chemisorbed onto a gold surface and then hybridized to a fluorophore-labeled complementary sequence. On formation of the duplex, the fluorescence of the label is effectively quenched by the gold surface. As the temperature is increased and the duplex denatures, the fluorophore label moves away from the gold surface and the fluorescence signal is again observed. The increase in fluorescence is measured as the temperature is ramped, and using first-derivative plots, the Tm is determined. To demonstrate the approach, the Tm of the cystic fibrosis DF508 mutation was determined in three different phases: in solution, in suspension immobilized on gold nanoparticles, and immobilized on gold film-coated substrate. The technique was further applied to optimize conditions for differentiation between a surface-immobilized DF508 mutant probe and a mutant/wild-type target exploiting increasing stringency in varying salt and formamide concentrations. The approach has application in optimization of assay conditions for biosensors that use gold substrates as well as in melting curve analysis. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper presents the two-dimensional simulation of heat propagation in the human eye model during contact lens wear with finite element analysis. Three types of contact lens are studied: Lotrafilcon A, Balafilcon A, and Etafilcon A. The models are solved for both steady and transient solutions. The corneal surface temperature during contact lens wear is found to decrease (average, 0.52 +/- 0.05 degrees C compared with a bare cornea for all lens types). A contact lens with a higher water content has a lower steady state temperature than a contact lens with a lower water content does. Various initial temperatures for the contact lens are found to affect the first 400 s of the temperature variation. When the initial temperature is lower than the corneal temperature, a reduction in temperature is observed during contact lens insertion while the opposite is observed when the initial temperature is higher than the corneal temperature. The increase in evaporation rate when a contact lens is worn increases the cooling effect on the ocular surface. This is suggested to be the cause of lower corneal surface temperature when wearing a contact lens.},

abstract = {The discovery of quantum oscillations in the normal-state electrical resistivity of YBa2Cu3O6.5 provides the first evidence for the existence of Fermi surface (FS) pockets in an underdoped cuprate. However, the pockets' electron vs. hole character, and the very interpretation in terms of closed FS contours, are the subject of considerable debate. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), with its ability to probe electronic dispersion as well as the FS, is ideally suited to address this issue. Unfortunately, the ARPES study of YBa2C3O7-d (YBCO) has been hampered by the technique's surface sensitivity. Here we show that this stems from the polarity and corresponding self-doping of the YBCO surface. By in-situ deposition of potassium atoms on the cleaved surface, we are able to continuously tune the doping of a single sample from the heavily overdoped to the underdoped regime. This reveals the progressive collapse of the normal-metal-like FS into four disconnected nodal FS arcs, or perhaps into hole but not electron pockets, in underdoped YBCO6.5.},

@article{Kustas2009,
abstract = {Over 10 years ago, John Norman and co-authors proposed a thermal-based land surface modeling strategy that treated the energy exchange and kinetic temperatures of the soil and vegetated components in a unique "Two-Source Model" (TSM) approach. The TSM formulation addresses key factors affecting the convective and radiative exchange within the soil-canopy-atmosphere system. focusing on the relationship between radiometric and aerodynamic temperature. John Norman's contribution came at a time when thermal-based techniques applied to standard "One-Source Model" (OSM) for large scale land surface flux and evapotranspiration (ET) estimation were generally considered unreliable and not viable for operational remote sensing applications. Others have subsequently modified OSM schemes to accommodate the radiometric-aerodynamic temperature relationship for partial canopy cover conditions, approaching accuracies achieved with the TSM. In this study, Norman's TSM and two current OSM schemes are evaluated over a range in canopy cover and moisture conditions simulated by the Cupid model-a complex soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) scheme developed by Norman that simulates the complete radiation, convection/turbulence and hydrologic processes occurring at the soil/canopy interface. The use of SVAT simulations permitted the evaluation of TSM and OSM approaches over a greater range of hydrometeorological and vegetation cover conditions than typically available from field observations. The utility of the TSM versus OSM approaches in handling extremes in moisture/vegetation cover conditions simulated by the SVAT model Cupid is presented. Generally the TSM approach outperformed the OSM schemes for the extreme conditions. Moreover, the ability of the TSM to partition ET into evaporation and transpiration components provides additional hydrologic information about the moisture status of the soil and canopy system, and about the vertical distribution of moisture in the soil profile (surface layer vs. root zone). Examples for actual landscapes are presented in the application of the TSM as incorporated within in the Atmosphere Land EXchange Inverse/Disaggregation ALEXI (ALEXI/DisALEXI) modeling system, designed for operational applications at local to continental scales using multi-scale thermal imagery. This strategy for utilizing radiometric surface temperature in land surface modeling has converted many skeptics and more importantly rejuvenated many in the research and operational remote sensing community to reconsider the utility of thermal infrared remote sensing for monitoring land surface fluxes from local to regional scales.

The record shows a clear millennial-scale pattern that is very similar to climate fluctuations observed in Antarctic ice cores, suggesting that the Southern Hemisphere high-latitude climate changes extended into the midlatitudes, involving simultaneous changes in air temperatures over Antarctica, sea ice extent, extension of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and westerly atmospheric circulation. A comparison to other midlatitude surface ocean records suggests that this ‘‘Antarctic’’ millennial-scale pattern was probably a hemisphere-wide phenomenon. In addition, we performed SST gradient reconstructions over the complete latitudinal range of the Pacific Eastern Boundary Current System for different time intervals during the last 70 kyr.

Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jim\'{e}nez-Mu\~{n}oz algorithm is used. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This study examines the bulk aerodynamic method for estimating surface fluxes of heat and moisture using the surface radiative temperature. The surface radiative temperature is often the only available surface temperature from field measurements. Models typically predict heat fluxes from the surface radiative temperature computed from the surface energy balance. In this study, the corresponding radiometric exchange coefficient and radiometric roughness height are computed from tower- and low- level aircraft data taken during four different field programs. The data analysis shows that the radiometric exchange coefficient does not increase with increasing instability. This is because the radiometric exchange coefficient must compensate for the large vertical temperature difference resulting from use of the surface radiative temperature. The data analysis and scaling arguments indicate that the radiometric exchange coefficient for heat in the bulk aerodynamic formulation is closely related to theta(*)/Delta theta for both stable and unstable conditions, where Delta theta is the difference between the surface radiative temperature and the air temperature and theta(*) is the negative of the heat flux divided by the surface friction velocity. Application of Monin- Obukhov similarity theory with surface radiative temperature also reduces to a relatively circular internal relationship between the radio,netric roughness height and theta(*)/Delta theta. This roughness height is flow dependent and not systematically related to the roughness height for momentum. As an additional complication. the observed radiometric exchange coefficient for heat depends on the relationship between the measured surface radiative temperature and the microscale distribution of surface radiative temperature in the footprint of the heat flux measurement. Analogous problems affect the prediction of the moisture Aux based on the saturation vapor pressure at the surface radiative temperature},

The results suggest that the temperature increase enhanced the evaporative enrichment of 18O in seawater. Transport of part of the additional atmospheric water vapor to extratropical latitudes may have sustained the 18O/16O anomaly. The reduced glacial-Holocene shift in seawater 18O/16O ratio produced by the mid-Holocene 18O enrichment may help to reconcile the different temperature histories for the last deglaciation given by coral Sr/Ca thermometry and foraminiferal oxygen-isotope records.},

Recent theoretical studies have predicted such a pattern as a response of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system to an exogenous heating of the tropical atmosphere. This pattern, however, is not reproduced by the complex ocean-atmosphere circulation models currently used to simulate the climatic response to increased greenhouse gases.

We also compare the latitudinal distribution of temperature trends from the surface and troposphere with each other and with model simulations for the past 26 years. The observations at the surface and in the troposphere are consistent with climate model simulations. At middle and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, the zonally averaged temperature at the surface increased faster than in the troposphere while at low latitudes of both hemispheres the temperature increased more slowly at the surface than in the troposphere. The resulting global averaged tropospheric trend is + 0.20 K/ 10 yr, with a standard error of 0.05 K/ 10 yr, which compares very well with the trend obtained from surface reports.},

abstract = {Using multispectral remote sensing, glacier surfaces can be classified into a range of zones. The properties of these classes are used for a range of glaciological applications including mass balance measurements, glacial hydrology, and melt modelling. However, it is not immediately evident that multispectral data should be optimal for imaging glaciers and ice caps. Thus, this investigation takes an inverse perspective. Taking into account spectral and radiometric properties, in situ spectral reflectance data were used to simulate glacier surface response for a suite of multispectral sensors. Sensor-simulated data were classified and compared. In addition, airborne multispectral imagery was classified for a range of spatial resolutions and intercompared in three different ways. In these analyses, the most important property which determined the suitability of a multispectral imager for glacier surface classification was its radiometric range (i.e. gain settings). Low resolution imagery (250. m. pixels) is too coarse to represent the true complexity present on a glacier while medium resolution imagery (60. m, 30. m, or 20. m) accurately represented the results derived from high resolution airborne imagery. Of those studied here, the satellite imagers currently in use that are most suitable for glacier surface classification are Landsat TM/ETM. + and ASTER (each with particular gain settings). Both Sentinel-2 and the OLI on Landsat 8 are also expected to be similarly qualified. Landsat MSS is also found to be radiometrically well-suited for glacier surface classification, but its lower spatial resolution makes it a secondary selection. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Over the range of values expected in oceanic surface waters, both salinity and total alkalinity affected the pH temperature correction to a small extent (??pH <0.0017).

abstract = {We define volcanic unrest as the deviation from the background or baseline behaviour of a volcano towards a behaviour which is a cause for concern in the short-term because it might prelude an eruption. When unrest is preceded by periods of quiescence over centuries or millennia it is particularly difficult to foresee how a volcano might behave in the short-term. As a consequence, one of the most important problems is to assess whether unrest will culminate in an eruption or not. Here, we review and evaluate global unrest reports of the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program (GVP) between January 2000 and July 2011. The aim of the evaluation is to establish the nature and length of unrest activity to test whether there are common temporal patterns in unrest indicators and whether there is a link between the length of inter-eruptive periods and unrest duration across different volcano types. A database is created from the reported information on unrest at 228 volcanoes. The data is categorised into pre-eruptive or non-eruptive unrest indicators at four different subaerial volcano types and submarine volcanoes as defined by the GVP. Unrest timelines demonstrate how unrest evolved over time and highlight different classes of unrest including reawakening, pulsatory, prolonged, sporadic and intra-eruptive unrest. Statistical tests indicate that pre-eruptive unrest duration was different across different volcano types. 50\% of stratovolcanoes erupted after about one month of reported unrest. At large calderas this median average duration of pre-eruptive unrest was about twice as long. At almost five months, shield volcanoes had a significantly longer unrest period before the onset of eruption, compared to both large calderas and stratovolcanoes. At complex volcanoes, eruptive unrest was short lived with only a median average duration of two days. We find that there is only a poor correlation between the length of the inter-eruptive period and unrest duration in the data; statistical significance was only detected for the pair-wise comparison of non-eruptive unrest at large calderas and stratovolcanoes. Results indicate that volcanoes with long periods of quiescence between eruptions will not necessarily undergo prolonged periods of unrest before their next eruption.Our findings may have implications for hazard assessment, risk mitigation and scenario planning during future unrest crises. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {The 'force-restore' approach is commonly used in order to calculate the surface temperature in atmospheric models. A critical point in this method is how to calculate the deep soil temperature which appears in the restore term of the 'force-restore' equation. If the prognostic equation for calculating the deep soil temperature is used, some errors in surface temperature calculation and consequently in partitioning the surface energy and land surface water can be introduced. Usually, these errors should appear as a result of incorrect parameterization of surface energy terms in the prognostic equation based on 'force-restore' approach.In this paper, the sensitivity of the 'force-restore' model for surface temperature to the: (a) changes of soil heat flux; (b) variations of deep soil temperature and (c) changes in soil water evaporation is examined. In addition, the impact of the deep soil temperature variations on partitioning the surface energy and land surface water is discussed. Finally, a new procedure for calculating the deep soil temperature based, on climatological data of soil temperature and its exponential attenuation in the deep soil layers is suggested. All numerical experiments with the LAPS land surface scheme were performed using two data sets, obtained from the micrometeorological measurements over a bare soil at Rimski Sancevi (Yugoslavia), RS, and Caumont (France), HAPEX.

Thermocouples were positioned at two locations on the proximal root surfaces. Samples were embedded in plaster and brought to 37??C in a water bath. Posts were ultrasonically vibrated for 4 minutes while continuously measuring temperature. Two-way ANOVA compared effects of water coolant and thermocouple location on temperature change.

A trend for higher temperatures was observed at coronal thermocouples of nonirrigated teeth and at apical thermocouples of irrigated teeth (p = 0.057).

These improvements allow better analysis of temperatures throughout the record, with the greatest improvements in the late nineteenth century and since 1985. Improvements in the late nineteenth century are due to improved tuning of the analysis methods. Beginning in 1985, improvements are due to the inclusion of bias-adjusted satellite data.

Supposing this hypothesis to be valid, the behavior of liquid-solid contact on an extremely smooth surface such as a single-crystal surface is expected to be very different from that on a metal surface of standard roughness. In this report, to examine the hypothesis, the Leidenfrost temperature is measured on single-crystal and metal plates. The maximum surface roughness of the former is 0.03 ??m, and that of the latter is 1.25 ??m. Results of the experiment show that the Leidenfrost temperatures on these two surfaces do not differ from each other as long as the surfaces are the same in wettability and thermal conductivity (or thermal diffusivity). Visual observation of the transient and localized wetted area on the single-crystal surface shows that numerous tiny dry spots are formed in the wetted area even at initial surface superheats lower than the minimum superheat to activate the preexisting nucleus of 0.03 ??m radius. These results imply that the hypothesis employed in most of the existing heat transfer models on transition boiling must be reexamined.},

Here the averages of a new surface-temperature analysis are compared to an estimate of the global average which has been used for monitoring surface-temperature variations at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) since 1998. As a replacement to the existing method, this new analysis uses improved methods that provide error estimates as well as the ability to perform analyses on finer spatial scales. Comparisons show only minor global-average differences, and the two estimates indicate essentially the same trend over the historical record, beginning in 1880. The two are most similar after about 1970, a period with a large change in the global-average temperature. The uncertainty estimates computed here account for changes in sampling and for systematic bias uncertainties. The means of the different analyses generally fall within the uncertainty estimates. The uncertainty computed here indicates that anomalies in the 19th century may not be significant, but the 20th century trends are significant},

We compiled numerous indicators of these resources into a geographic information system along with concurrent investigative results. This effort required acquisition and analysis of spaceborne multispectral and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for early-stage geothermal exploration. We identified minerals such as alunite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite through analysis of hyperspectral data indicating regions of hydrothermally altered rock associated with areas of geothermal potential. Tertiary volcanic and granitic rocks also contain these indicator minerals. Quaternary environments displayed gypsum-bearing evaporite crusts that we postulate were deposited by sulfate-rich thermal waters. Throughout the PLPTL, tufa towers and tufa shoreline deposits are extensively distributed as remnants of paleo-lake Lahontan. Based on measured spectra of calcium carbonate, we mapped tufa towers elucidating the strike direction of associated faults. Additionally, we correlated remotely-derived maps of shoreline tufa deposits with climate-related changes in lake level. Our mapping results helped guide detailed exploration efforts to areas with the most geothermal potential. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

According to the International Geographic Data Committee (IGDC), coastlines are one of the most important environmental heritages on the earth’s surface. In the coastal areas, main challenge is to understand the present coastline dynamics and to predict its future developments. Therefore the coastal zone monitoring is an essential process for sustainable coastal management and environmental protection. Shoreline extraction is an important issue for coastal zone monitoring. In this study, efficiency of two different methods for detection of coastline features from satellite images, which cover Lakeland region of Turkey, has been tested. Firstly, object based classification method (OBC) has been used to extract shoreline automatically. Developed process based rule set extracts coastline as a vector file from satellite imagery. As a second method, support vector machine (SVM) algorithm has been used to extract coastline. For the application of these two different methods, Landsat 8 data have been used. The results of these two automatic coastline extraction methods were compared with the results derived from manual digitization process. Random control points over the coastline were used in the evaluation. Results showed that both methods have a sub-pixel accuracy to detect coastline features from Landsat 8 imagery.},

abstract = {Large-scale convection over the warm tropical oceans provides an important portion of the driving energy for the general circulation of the atmosphere. Analysis of regional associations between ocean temperature, surface wind divergence, and convection produced two important results. First, over broad regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in excess of 27.5 degrees C are required for large-scale deep convection to occur. However, SSTs above that temperature are not a sufficient condition for convection and further increases in SST appear to have little effect on the intensity of convection. Second, when SSTs are above 27.5 degrees C, surface wind divergence is closely associated with the presence or absence of deep convection. Although this result could have been expected, it was also found that areas of persistent divergent surface flow coincide with regions where convection appears to be consistently suppressed even when SSTs are above 27.5 degrees C. Thus changes in atmospheric stability caused by remotely forced changes in subsidence aloft may play a major role in regulating convection over warm tropical oceans.},

abstract = {Plasma actuators have become the topic of interest of many researchers for the purpose of flow control. They have the advantage of manipulating the flow without the need for any moving parts, a small surface profile which does not disturb the free stream flow, and the ability to switch them on or off depending on the particular situation (active flow control). Due to these characteristics they are becoming very popular for flow control over aircraft wings. The objective of the current study is to examine the effect of the actuator surface temperature on its performance. This is an important topic to understand when dealing with real life aircraft equipped with plasma actuators. The temperature variations encountered during a flight envelope may have adverse effects in actuator performance. A peltier heater along with dry ice are used to alter the actuator temperature, while particle image velocimetry (PIV) is utilised to analyse the flow field. The results show a significant change in the induced flow field by the actuator as the surface temperature is varied. It is found that for a constant peak-to-peak voltage the maximum velocity produced by the actuator depends directly on the dielectric surface temperature. The findings suggest that by changing the actuator temperature the performance can be maintained or even altered at different environmental conditions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The new Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) is intended to be broadly compatible with the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). The spectral response of the OLI is slightly different to the ETM+, and so there may be slight differences in the reflectance measurements. Since the differences are a function not just of spectral responses, but also of the target pixels, there is a need to assess these differences in practice, using imagery from the area of interest. This paper presents a large scale study of the differences between ETM+ and OLI in the Australian landscape. The analysis is carried out in terms of both top-of-atmosphere and surface reflectance, and also in terms of biophysical parameters modelled from those respective reflectance spectra. The results show small differences between the sensors, which can be magnified by modelling to a biophysical parameter. It is also shown that a part of this difference appears to be systematic, and can be reliably removed by regression equations to predict ETM+ reflectance from OLI reflectance, before applying biophysical models. This is important when models have been fitted to historical field data coincident with ETM+ imagery. However, there will remain a small per-pixel difference which could be an unwanted source of variability.},

abstract = {A consistent nomenclature for thermal infrared remote sensing of natural surfaces is outlined in this paper. Terms such as `canopy temperature' and `surface temperature' should be confined to general, qualitative descriptions and terms such as directional radiometric temperature, hemispherical emissivity, aerodynamic temperature, or hemispherical-directional reflectance used for technical precision. Some discussion also is included on the relation between hemispherical-directional thermal reflectance and directional thermal emissivity. A distinction is made between two kinds of emissivity; e-emissivity and r-emissivity. Through use of detailed models of directional thermal emissivity and bidirectional reflectance, we suggest that the influence of temperature gradients in vegetation on directional emissivity usually will cause uncertainties of less than 0.005. In addition, uncertainties that occur in estimating surface temperature, which arise because an ensemble of black bodies each at a different temperature does not have a black body radiance distribution with temperature, will not always be negligible for purposes of remote sensing of natural surfaces. Differences between mean thermodynamic and ensemble radiometric temperatures of 1 K or larger are possible even though differences in ensemble radiometric temperatures for different wavelength bands in the atmospheric window (8-14 mum) usually will be less than 0.1 K.},

abstract = {The surface temperature of Mercury will be monitored by the IR radiometer on board the MPO orbiter of the BepiColombo mission. These results are expected to provide information about regolith thermal and thermo-optical properties at the surface, but also in the near subsurface. The presence of physical heterogeneities, resulting in discontinuities of the vertical profiles of subsurface physical parameters (like thermal conductivity, heat capacity, porosity, etc.) is expected to imprint its signature on the time evolution of surface temperature, in particular at twilight, when the temperature does rapidly vary, and during the night. It might as well affect the absolute level of surface temperature, on both dayside and nightside, due to possible horizontal variations of thermal inertia, because of topography and/or geographical variations of regolith textural properties. We have therefore developed a thermal model of Mercury's regolith which includes radiative and conductive effects, and tests the effect of various subsurface inhomogeneities on the observed temperature curves. Such a model describes the diurnal variation of the surface temperature and of the temperature profile in the first meters below the surface. This model has been tested with respect to known measurements of Mercury's surface temperature [Chase, S.C., Miner, Jr., E.D., Morrison, D. et al. Mariner 10 infrared radiometer results: temperatures and thermal properties of the surface of Mercury. Icarus 28, 655-578, 1976] and previous existing models [Hale, A.S., Hapke, B.

abstract = {This work addresses the experimental measurements of the surface tension of eight imidazolium based ionic liquids (ILs) and their dependence with the temperature (288-353 K) and water content. The set of selected ionic liquids was chosen to provide a comprehensive study of the influence of the cation alkyl chain length, the number of cation substitutions and the anion on the properties under study. The influence of water content in the surface tension was studied for several ILs as a function of the temperature as well as a function of water mole fraction, for the most hydrophobic IL investigated, [omim][PF6], and one of the more hygroscopic IL, [bmim][PF6]. The surface thermodynamic functions such as surface entropy and enthalpy were derived from the temperature dependence of the surface tension values. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wan1996,
abstract = {Proposes a generalized split-window method for retrieving
land-surface temperature (LST) from AVHRR and MODIS data. Accurate
radiative transfer simulations show that the coefficients in the
split-window algorithm for LST must vary with the viewing angle, if the
authors are to achieve a LST accuracy of about 1 K for the whole scan
swath range (\&amp;plusmn;55\&amp;deg; from nadir) and for the ranges of surface
temperature and atmospheric conditions over land, which are much wider
than those over oceans. The authors obtain these coefficients from
regression analysis of radiative transfer simulations, and they analyze
sensitivity and error over wide ranges of surface temperature and
emissivity and atmospheric water vapor abundance and temperature.
Simulations show that when atmospheric water vapor increases and viewing
angle is larger than 45\&amp;deg;, it is necessary to optimize the
split-window method by separating the ranges of the atmospheric water
vapor, lower boundary temperature, and the surface temperature into
tractable subranges. The atmospheric lower boundary temperature and
(vertical) column water vapor values retrieved from HIRS/2 or MODIS
atmospheric sounding channels can be used to determine the range for the
optimum coefficients of the split-window method. This new algorithm not
only retrieves land-surface temperature more accurately, but is also
less sensitive to uncertainty in emissivity and to instrument
quantization error},

The surface and air temperature pattern are studied on a city scale and on a canyon scale. Data from ordinary weather stations and three specially designed weather stations are used. Recordings of temperature, humidity and wind are also made by an infrared thermography system (Thermovision 870), measurement cars and dataloggers. The geometry of the city is described by the sky view factor (SVF). In general the results show a lesser temperature variation than expected. The surface temperature varies a few degrees between different urban geometries, but the air temperature variation is very small. Further studies are planned to determine the temperature variation within the city and between the city and the suburbs.},
