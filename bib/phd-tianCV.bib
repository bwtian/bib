abstract = {Surface roughness is an important variable of geomorphologic research and hydrological modeling, and widely used in the Earth and planetary science. It plays an important role in determining how a ground object will interact with its environment. Quantification of surface-roughness variability using Digital elevation model (DEM) were applied to study area of Beichuan County, one of the most destructed areas during the Wenchuan earthquake (7.9 Mw at 14:28:01.42 CST on May 12, 2008). In this paper, four types of DEM were chosen for multi-scale assessment of the surface roughness. Three algorithms were employed, which were Root mean square of elevation, standard deviation of elevation, standard deviation of curvature profile. An overall trend of inclined to be flat from pre-earthquake to post-earthquake could be examined through the three measure methods, which indicate that Wenchuan earthquake indeed had effects on changing the surface roughness. The method of Root mean square of elevation shows the most obvious results in depicting the change before and after the earthquake. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Wenchuan (汶川) earthquake triggered cascading disasters of landslides and debris flows that caused severe vegetation damage. Fracture zones can affect geodynamics and spatial pattern of vegetation damage. A segment tracing algorithm method was applied for identifying the regional fracture system through lineament extractions from a shaded digital elevation model with 25 m mesh for southern Wenchuan. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were used to analyze the spatiotemporal vegetation pattern. The relationship between vegetation type identified from satellite images and lineament density was used to characterize the distribution patterns of each vegetation type according to fracture zones. Broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, and farmland persist in areas with moderate lineament density. Deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forest persists in less fractured areas. Shrub and meadow seem to be relatively evenly distributed across all lineament densities. Meadow, farmland, and shrub persist in the fractured areas. Changes of spatial structure and correlation between vegetation patterns before and after the earthquake were examined using semivariogram analysis of normalized difference vegetation indices derived from Landsat enhanced thematic mapper images. The sill values of the semivariograms show that the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation covers increased after the earthquake. Moreover, the anisotropic behaviors of the semivariograms coincide with the vegetation changes due to the strikes of fracture zones.},

This paper focused on mapping the variability of geothermal resource through a combination of Thermal infrared remote sensing (TIR) and borehole data with temperature logging in Hokkaido Island, northern Japan. The result showed that that the zones with the highest geothermal potential in Hokkaido Island are located in the volcanic areas. Moreover, similarity between the distributions of LST and the temperature at a great depth was identified.
