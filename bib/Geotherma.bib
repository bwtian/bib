abstract = {We present the first quantitative representation of the intensity of Yellowstone National Park's surficial geothermal activity mapped continuously in space. A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km2 landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0??W m- 2 up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94??W m- 2 (at the 28.5??m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r = 0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone's famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {With more than 30years of imagery, the Landsat database offers potential insights into changes in the global cryosphere. In this study, a Landsat-based sub-pixel fractional snow covered area retrieval model based on spectral unmixing is applied and validated over a southern Andes study region. An application analyzing minimum annual snow/ice covered areas is presented as an example of the utility of the existence of such a model and the Landsat database. The model was validated using high-resolution imagery aggregated to the nominal Landsat resolution, showing good correlation for both fresh snow and ice/old snow presence. Using annual minimum snow/ice retrievals from Landsat 5 and 7, the presence of trends in each snow/ice-covered pixel area was assessed for the 1986-2013 historical period, and three metrics were examined: pixels with significant negative trends, total area loss, and areas with any absolute negative change. Significant negative (area reduction) trends in most of the glacier fronts were found, with a loss of approximately 15\% of the original 241km2 glacierized/snow area between 1986 and 2011. Trends in fractional values were compared with those derived from traditional binary classification of snow and significant discrepancies were observed. Even though the binary classification identified a greater total areal loss (33 vs. 23km2) when comparing scenes from the beginning and the end of the study period, the fractional algorithm identified a larger number of pixels with significant negative trends between 1986 and 2013 (42.3 vs. 10.5km2). The binary algorithm resulted in consistent overestimations of ice and snow area and does not offer the ability for identifying subpixel changes. The method could enable future monitoring of Andean and other glaciers and snow cover at a sub-pixel scale over large scales, and with Landsat 8 in orbit a continuous stream of more than 30years of data is already available.

abstract = {Monitoring coastal and inland waters, recognized as case II waters, using the existing Landsat technology is somewhat restricted because of its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its rela- tively poor radiometric resolution. The new generation of Landsat, Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) carrying the Opera- tional Land Imager (OLI), has enhanced features allowing for a more lucid characterization of water constituents in either coastal or inland waters with respect to Landsat-7 (ETM+). This paper applies a physics-based approach to fully examine the potential of OLI in terms of its enhanced features in a water constituent retrieval framework. An EO-1 dataset, including Hyperion and the Advanced Land Imager (ALI), together with nearly coinci- dent ETM+ imagery were atmospherically corrected using a data- driven approach. An in-water radiative transfer model, i.e., Hy- drolight, was applied to generate a Look-Up-Table (LUT) of sim- ulated surface reflectances for various combinations of water con- stituents. Using the Hyperion-derived concentration maps as val- idation sources, it was found that the simulated OLI imagery is superior to ETM+ on the order of 40\%, 20\%, and 28\% when re- trieving the concentrations of chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids (TSS), as well as the absorption of the colored dissolved or- ganic matter (CDOM), respectively. It was also demonstrated that the simulatedOLIimagery outperforms the simulated ALI and the recorded ALI datasets in the retrieval of chlorophyll-a andCDOM absorption. It is concluded that the new generation of Landsat en- ables mapping and monitoring of case II waters with accuracies not achieved with the previous Landsat satellite series.},

abstract = {The Landsat-8 satellite of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in April 2013. Just weeks after it entered active service, its sensors observed activity at Paluweh Volcano, Indonesia. Given that the image acquired was in the daytime, its shortwave infrared observations were contaminated with reflected solar radiation; however, those of the satelliteâs Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) show thermal emission from the volcanoâs summit and flanks. These emissions detected in sensorâs band 10 (10.60â11.19 Âµm) have here been quantified in terms of radiant power, to confirm reports of the actual volcanic processes operating at the time of image acquisition, and to form an initial assessment of the TIRS in its volcanic observation capabilities. Data from band 11 have been neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable at the time of writing. At the instant of image acquisition, the thermal emission of the volcano was found to be 345 MW. This value is shown to be on the same order of magnitude as similarly timed NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer thermal observations. Given its unique characteristics, the TIRS shows much potential for providing useful, detailed and accurate volcanic observations in the future.},

@article{VanderMeer2014,
abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25â30Â°C per kilometer depth, however in active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150Â°C per kilometer depth can be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hot water is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles are evidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling and drying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper we review the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from the traditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirect detection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat fluxes, geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to published remote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions, mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from the La Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between various surface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute to exploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached full maturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework. A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and the present contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number of question lines: âhow reproducible are remote sensing productsâ, âcan long term monitoring of geothermal systems be achievedâ and âdo surface manifestations link to subsurface featuresâ?},

abstract = {We analyse shortwave infrared thermal data of the phase 1 eruption of Unzen Volcano (Japan) extracted from eight nighttime Thematic Mapper (TM) images taken from the Landsat 5 satellite between October 1991 and November 1992. We identify two discrete regions of the dome that were heated to high temperature by the ongoing eruptive activity; a fumarolically heated region and an area associated with the effusion of new lava. We concentrate analysis on the fumarolically heated region and investigate the relationships between parameters derived from the infrared radiance data and the nature of the fumarolic gas and magma fluxes. Temporal variations in the parameters derived from the radiance data closely follow those observed in the measured rate of magma effusion. The positive correlation observed between the fumarolically driven shortwave infrared flux and the magma discharge rate (r2 = 0.64) indicates that degassing occurred efficiently and in proportion to the amount of magma supplied. Over our monitoring period, the data suggest that gas accumulation within the edifice did not occur, this conclusion agreeing with a previous finding obtained using correlation spectrometer (COSPEC) analysis of SO2 flux rates. A positive correlation (r2 = 0.56) was also found between the mean radiance of the pixels in the fumarolically heated region and the overall size of that region. This suggests a potential mechanism whereby, when gas pressure within the edifice increased, excess gas escaped through additional pathways to the surface as well through an increased flux at the main fumarolic vents.},

abstract = {Linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA) is commonly used to infer fractional vegetation cover (FVC), especially for pixel dichotomy models. However, several sources of uncertainty including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) saturation and selection of endmembers inhibit the effectiveness of SMA for the estimation of FVC. In this study, Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing data for the early growing season and in situ measurement of spectral reflectance are used to determine the value of endmembers including VIsoil and VIveg, with equally weighted RVI and NDVI measures used in combination to minimize the inherent biases in pure NDVI-based FVC. Their ability to improve estimates of grassland FVC is analyzed at different resolutions. These are shown to improve FVC estimates over NDVI-based SMA models using fixed values for the endmembers. Grassland FVC changes for Inner Mongolia, China from 2000 to 2013 are then monitored using the MODIS data. The results show that changes in most grassland areas are not significant, but in parts of Hulunbeier, south Tongliao, middle Xilin Gol and Erdos, grassland FVC has increased significantly.},

abstract = {In this study, the potential of EO-1 Advanced Land Imager (ALI) radiometer for land cover and especially burnt area mapping from a single image analysis is investigated. Co-orbital imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) was also utilised for comparison purposes. Both images were acquired shortly after the suppression of a fire occurred during the summer of 2009 North-East of Athens, the capital of Greece. The Maximum Likelihood (ML), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifiers were parameterised and subsequently applied to the acquired satellite datasets. Evaluation of the land use/cover mapping accuracy was based on the error matrix statistics. Also, the McNemar test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences between the approaches tested. Derived burnt area estimates were validated against the operationally deployed Services and Applications For Emergency Response (SAFER) Burnt Scar Mapping service. All classifiers applied to either ALI or TM imagery proved flexible enough to map land cover and also to extract the burnt area from other land surface types. The highest total classification accuracy and burnt area detection capability was returned from the application of SVMs to ALI data. This was due to the SVMs ability to identify an optimal separating hyperplane for best classes' separation that was able to better utilise ALI's advanced technological characteristics in comparison to those of TM sensor. This study is to our knowledge the first of its kind, effectively demonstrating the benefits of the combined application of SVMs to ALI data further implying that ALI technology may prove highly valuable in mapping burnt areas and land use/cover if it is incorporated into the development of Landsat 8 mission, planned to be launched in the coming years. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Arctic is among the regions with the most rapid changes in climate and has the expected highest increase in temperature. Changes in the timing of phenological phases, such as onset of the growing season observed from remote sensing, are among the most sensitive bio-indicators of climate change. The study area here is the High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, located between 76Â°30Ê¹ and 80Â°50Ê¹N. The goal of this study was to use MODIS Terra data (the MOD09Q1 and MOD09A1 surface reflectance products, both with 8-day temporal composites) to map the onset of the growing season on Svalbard for the 2000â2013 period interpreted from field observations. Due to a short and intense period with greening-up and frequent cloud cover, all the cloud free data is needed, which requires reliable cloud masks. We used a combination of three cloud removing methods (State QA values, own algorithms, and manual removal). This worked well, but is time-consuming as it requires manual interpretation of cloud cover. The onset of the growing season was then mapped by a NDVI threshold method, which showed high correlation (r2 = 0.60, n = 25, p \&lt; 0.001) with field observations of flowering of Salix polaris (polar willow). However, large bias was found between NDVI-based mapped onset and field observations in bryophyte-dominated areas, which indicates that the results in these parts must be interpreted with care. On average for the 14-year period, the onset of the growing season occurs after July 1st in 68.4\% of the vegetated areas of Svalbard. The mapping revealed large variability between years. The years 2000 and 2008 were extreme in terms of late onset of the growing season, and 2002 and 2013 had early onset. Overall, no clear trend in onset of the growing season for the 2000â2013 period was found.},

abstract = {Thermal activity monitoring in and around active volcanic areas using remote sensing is an essential part of volcanology nowadays. Three identical approaches were used for thermal activity exploration at Aso volcanic area in Japan using Landsat ETM+images. First, the conventional methods for hydrothermal alteration mapping were applied to find the most active thermal region after exploring geothermal indicator minerals. Second, we found some thermally highly anomalous regions around Nakadake crater using land surface temperature estimation. Then, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation was used for estimating and also monitoring radiative heat flux (RHF) from the most active region of about 8km2 in and around Nakadake crater in the central part of the Aso volcano. To fulfill the required parameter in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux, the NDVI (Normalized differential vegetation index) method was used for spectral emissivity, and the mono-window algorithm was used for land surface temperature of this study area. The NDVI value was used to divide land-cover in the study area into four types: water, bare ground, mixed and vegetated land. The bare land was found within the most active region. Vegetation coverage area showed an inverse relationship with total RHF in this study as health of thermally stressed vegetation supports this relationship. The spatial distribution of spectral emissivity ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 in our study. Land surface temperature was estimated using a mono-window algorithm and was highest LST in 2008 and lowest in 2011. The results of RHF showed that the highest pixel RHF was found to be about 296W/m2 in 2008. Total RHF was obtained of about 607MW in 2002 and the lowest was about 354MW in 2008. The RHF anomaly area was found the highest in 2002 and was lowest in 2011. The highest total heat discharge rate (HDR) obtained about 3918MW in 2002 and lowest total HDR about 2289MW in 2008 from this study area. But in the case of Nakadake crater alone, the higher thermal activity was observed in 2008 and was less in 2004. The study showed that Landsat thermal infrared is the best option for thermal activity exploration and monitoring at Aso volcano as well as in any active volcano region considering high efficiency and low cost.},

Geothermal systems at depth may be identified at the surface by hot springs and fumaroles or by minerals produced by thermal fluids (hydrothermal alteration and hot spring deposits). Northern Fish Lake Valley, Nevada hosts two previously known geothermal fields. This study expanded prospects and identified new areas for future exploration within the valley. We demonstrated the potential for using remote sensing data to evaluate regions that are not well explored. We used visible, near, and shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5. ??m) remote sensing data to map surficial mineralogy. Data were collected by three airborne imaging spectrometer instruments, AVIRIS, HyMap, and ProSpecTIR, each over different parts of Fish Lake Valley. Minerals were identified using diagnostic spectral features. We verified remote sensing results in the field using a portable spectrometer to confirm agreement between field and remote spectra.The discovery of additional geothermal resources in Fish Lake Valley may provide the necessary added incentive to build costly transmission lines to this remote location. We used remote sensing data to delineate four new targets for future geothermal exploration in northern Fish Lake Valley. Two new areas of sinter and travertine deposits were identified northwest of the playa, likely deposited around fault-controlled hot springs during the Pleistocene when the water table was higher. Previously undocumented Miocene crystalline travertine was identified within the Emigrant Hills. Argillic alteration was mapped within ranges, where thermal fluids were likely discharged from faults to alter rhyolite tuff. Here we explain our data processing techniques which include a novel decorrelation stretch designed for geothermal prospecting, and discuss how remote sensing results guided our interpretation of the region's geothermal systems. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Burn scar extraction using remote sensing data is an efficient way to precisely evaluate burn area and measure vegetation recovery. Traditional burn scar extraction methodologies have no well effect on burn scar image with blurred and irregular edges. To address these issues, this paper proposes an automatic method to extract burn scar based on Level Set Method (LSM). This method utilizes the advantages of the different features in remote sensing images, as well as considers the practical needs of extracting the burn scar rapidly and automatically. This approach integrates Change Vector Analysis (CVA), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) to obtain difference image and modifies conventional Level Set Method Chan-Vese (C-V) model with a new initial curve which results from a binary image applying K-means method on fitting errors of two near-infrared band images. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI data sets are used to validate the proposed method. Comparison with conventional C-V model, OSTU algorithm, Fuzzy C-mean (FCM) algorithm are made to show that the proposed approach can extract the outline curve of fire burn scar effectively and exactly. The method has higher extraction accuracy and less algorithm complexity than that of the conventional C-V model.},

abstract = {The Landsat-8 satellite of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in April 2013. Just weeks after it entered active service, its sensors observed activity at Paluweh Volcano, Indonesia. Given that the image acquired was in the daytime, its shortwave infrared observations were contaminated with reflected solar radiation; however, those of the satelliteâs Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) show thermal emission from the volcanoâs summit and flanks. These emissions detected in sensorâs band 10 (10.60â11.19 Âµm) have here been quantified in terms of radiant power, to confirm reports of the actual volcanic processes operating at the time of image acquisition, and to form an initial assessment of the TIRS in its volcanic observation capabilities. Data from band 11 have been neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable at the time of writing. At the instant of image acquisition, the thermal emission of the volcano was found to be 345 MW. This value is shown to be on the same order of magnitude as similarly timed NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer thermal observations. Given its unique characteristics, the TIRS shows much potential for providing useful, detailed and accurate volcanic observations in the future.},

abstract = {Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) are currently operational for routine Earth observation. There are substantial differences between instruments onboard both satellites. The enhancements achieved with Landsat-8 refer to the scanning technology (replacing of whisk-broom scanners with two separate push-broom OLI and TIRS scanners), an extended number of spectral bands (two additional bands provided) and narrower bandwidths. Therefore, cross-comparative analysis is very necessary for the combined use of multi-decadal Landsat imagery. In this study, 3,311 independent sample points of four major land cover types (primary forest, unplanted cropland, swidden cultivation and water body) were used to compare the spectral bands of ETM+ and OLI. Eight sample plots with different land cover types were manually selected for comparison with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). These indices were calculated with six pairs of ETM+ and OLI cloud-free images, which were acquired over the border area of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand just two days apart, when Landsat-8 achieved operational obit. Comparative results showed that: (1) the average surface reflectance of each band differed slightly, but with a high degree of similarities between both sensors. In comparison with ETM+, the OLI had higher values for the near-infrared band for vegetative land cover types, but lower values for non-vegetative types. The new sensor had lower values for the shortwave infrared (2.11â2.29 Âµm) band for all land cover types. In addition, it also basically had higher values for the shortwave infrared (1.57â1.65 Âµm) band for non-water land cover types.

abstract = {In the last decade, the number of offshore wind farms has increased rapidly. Offshore wind farms are typically constructed in near-shore, shallow waters. These waters can be highly productive or provide nursery grounds for fish. EU legislation requires assessment of the environmental impact of the wind farms. The effects on hard and soft substrate fauna, seabirds and marine mammals are most frequently considered. Here we present Landsat-8 imagery that reveals the impact of offshore wind farms on suspended sediments. Turbid wakes of individual turbines are observed that are aligned with tidal currents. They are 30-150. m wide, and several km in length. The environmental impact of these wakes and the source of the suspended material are still unclear, but the wake size warrants further study. The underwater light field will be affected by increased suspended sediments and the turbid wakes could significantly impact sediment transport and downstream sedimentation. The question of whether such features can be detected by other remote sensors is addressed by a theoretical analysis of the signal:noise specification for the Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM. +), the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/3), the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and by a demonstration of the impact of processing OLI data for different spatial resolutions.

abstract = {The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Alaska Energy Author- ity are jointly funding a project to re-assess the resource potential of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. Phase one of this project has included airborne thermal infrared remote sensing for mapping surface geothermal phenomena and assess- ment of the resource potential of the system. Thermal infrared and optical images were acquired over the Pilgrim Hot Springs site and neighboring regions during two surveys in fall 2010 and spring 2011. Thermal images providing information on land surface temperature at a spatial resolution better than 1.3 meters were acquired using a FLIR A320 camera operating in the broad 7.5â13 Âµm wavelength region. Fieldwork during the airborne surveys gathered ground calibration and validation data such as hot spring, ground, and at- mospheric temperatures, atmospheric humidity and the precise GPS locations of low-emissivity ground targets. We applied atmospheric correction, registration and mosaicking to generate seamless maps of calibrated surface temperature across the study area. Analysis of this data enables delineation of the main geothermal features of the system including hot springs, pools, and areas of thermally anomalous ground. Using a thermal-budget approach the thermal heat flux sustaining surface geothermal waters was estimated from the fall and spring FLIR data. Calculated heat fluxes and outflow rates assuming a hot spring temperature of 81Â°C is significantly higher than previous field-based methods. Our work demonstrates that airborne thermal infrared remote sensing provides a rapid and relatively low cost method for mapping and quantitative assessment of undeveloped spring-dominated geothermal systems in Alaska},

abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25â30Â°C per kilometer depth, however in active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150Â°C per kilometer depth can be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hot water is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles are evidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling and drying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper we review the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from the traditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirect detection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat fluxes, geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to published remote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions, mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from the La Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between various surface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute to exploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached full maturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework. A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and the present contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number of question lines: âhow reproducible are remote sensing productsâ, âcan long term monitoring of geothermal systems be achievedâ and âdo surface manifestations link to subsurface featuresâ?},

abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) are developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA is responsible for building and launching the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185. km swath with a 30. m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15. m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100. m resolution over a 185. km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite "Landsat 8" following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Using multispectral remote sensing, glacier surfaces can be classified into a range of zones. The properties of these classes are used for a range of glaciological applications including mass balance measurements, glacial hydrology, and melt modelling. However, it is not immediately evident that multispectral data should be optimal for imaging glaciers and ice caps. Thus, this investigation takes an inverse perspective. Taking into account spectral and radiometric properties, in situ spectral reflectance data were used to simulate glacier surface response for a suite of multispectral sensors. Sensor-simulated data were classified and compared. In addition, airborne multispectral imagery was classified for a range of spatial resolutions and intercompared in three different ways. In these analyses, the most important property which determined the suitability of a multispectral imager for glacier surface classification was its radiometric range (i.e. gain settings). Low resolution imagery (250. m. pixels) is too coarse to represent the true complexity present on a glacier while medium resolution imagery (60. m, 30. m, or 20. m) accurately represented the results derived from high resolution airborne imagery. Of those studied here, the satellite imagers currently in use that are most suitable for glacier surface classification are Landsat TM/ETM. + and ASTER (each with particular gain settings). Both Sentinel-2 and the OLI on Landsat 8 are also expected to be similarly qualified. Landsat MSS is also found to be radiometrically well-suited for glacier surface classification, but its lower spatial resolution makes it a secondary selection. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) are currently operational for routine Earth observation. There are substantial differences between instruments onboard both satellites. The enhancements achieved with Landsat-8 refer to the scanning technology (replacing of whisk-broom scanners with two separate push-broom OLI and TIRS scanners), an extended number of spectral bands (two additional bands provided) and narrower bandwidths. Therefore, cross-comparative analysis is very necessary for the combined use of multi-decadal Landsat imagery. In this study, 3,311 independent sample points of four major land cover types (primary forest, unplanted cropland, swidden cultivation and water body) were used to compare the spectral bands of ETM+ and OLI. Eight sample plots with different land cover types were manually selected for comparison with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). These indices were calculated with six pairs of ETM+ and OLI cloud-free images, which were acquired over the border area of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand just two days apart, when Landsat-8 achieved operational obit. Comparative results showed that: (1) the average surface reflectance of each band differed slightly, but with a high degree of similarities between both sensors. In comparison with ETM+, the OLI had higher values for the near-infrared band for vegetative land cover types, but lower values for non-vegetative types. The new sensor had lower values for the shortwave infrared (2.11â2.29 Âµm) band for all land cover types. In addition, it also basically had higher values for the shortwave infrared (1.57â1.65 Âµm) band for non-water land cover types.

abstract = {Landsat 8, a NASA and USGS collaboration, acquires global moderate-resolution measurements of the Earth's terrestrial and polar regions in the visible, near-infrared, short wave, and thermal infrared. Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40. year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {We analyse the Mw 7.7 Balochistan earthquake of 09/24/2013 based on ground surface deformation measured from sub-pixel correlation of Landsat-8 images, combined with back-projection and finite source modeling of teleseismic waveforms. The earthquake nucleated south of the Chaman strike-slip fault and propagated southwestward along the Hoshab fault at the front of the Kech Band. The rupture was mostly unilateral, propagated at 3 km/s on average and produced a 200 km surface fault trace with purely strike-slip displacement peaking to 10 m and averaging around 6 m. The finite source model shows that slip was maximum near the surface. Although the Hoshab fault is dipping by 45?? to the North, in accordance with its origin as a thrust fault within the Makran accretionary prism, slip was nearly purely strike-slip during that earthquake. Large seismic slip on such a non-optimally oriented fault was enhanced possibly due to the influence of the free surface on dynamic stresses or to particular properties of the fault zone allowing for strong dynamic weakening. Strike-slip faulting on thrust fault within the eastern Makran is interpreted as due to eastward extrusion of the accretionary prism as it bulges out over the Indian plate. Portions of the Makran megathrust, some thrust faults in the Kirthar range and strike-slip faults within the Chaman fault system have been brought closer to failure by this earthquake.

abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an important technique in the exploration of geothermal resources. In this study, a geothermal survey is conducted in Tengchong area of Yunnan province in China using TIR data from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor. Based on radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and emissivity calculation, a simple but efficient single channel algorithm with acceptable precision is applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of study area. The LST anomalous areas with temperature about 4-10 K higher than background area are discovered. Four geothermal areas are identified with the discussion of geothermal mechanism and the further analysis of regional geologic structure. The research reveals that the distribution of geothermal areas is consistent with the fault development in study area. Magmatism contributes abundant thermal source to study area and the faults provide thermal channels for heat transfer from interior earth to land surface and facilitate the present of geothermal anomalies. Finally, we conclude that TIR remote sensing is a cost-effective technique to detect LST anomalies. Combining TIR remote sensing with geological analysis and the understanding of geothermal mechanism is an accurate and efficient approach to geothermal area detection. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Landsat 8, a NASA and USGS collaboration, acquires global moderate-resolution measurements of the Earth's terrestrial and polar regions in the visible, near-infrared, short wave, and thermal infrared. Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40. year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements. ?? 2014.},

abstract = { The data from the Landsat program constitutes the longest record of the Earth's surface as seen from space. Landsat 1 was launched in 1972 with the Multi-Spectral Scanner sensor (MSS), which was specifically designed for land remote sensing. This sensor proved so valuable that it was used with four subsequent Landsat missions. In 1982, Landsat 4 was launched with two sensors, MSS and a new sensor called the Thematic Mapper (TM) which had significant improvements in resolution as well as additional bands. The same payload was launched on Landsat 5 in 1984. Landsat 6 was launched in 1993 but failed to reach orbit. Landsat 7 was launched in 1999 with an improved TM sensor called the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+). The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) was launched in 2000 on the EO-1 (Earth Observer-1) satellite to test technology that will be used for the next Landsat platform, Landsat 8. In comparison to Landsat 7 ETM+, EO1 ALI provides a greater signal to noise ratio, a pushbroom sensor, greater quantization, and additional wavelength bands. As technology evolved, newer Landsat sensors were modified slightly while keeping in mind the importance of historical data continuity. There is a keen interest in documenting data continuity over the different Landsat sensors. This study attempts to quantify (within the limits of available information) data continuity over the three most recent Landsat sensors and the EO-1 ALI sensor. The data set in this analysis includes images from Landsat 4, 5, and 7 TM beginning in 1989 and images from the EO-1ALI platform acquired in 2001. All the images used were received radiometrically corrected to NASA level 1.},

abstract = {The U.S. currently leads the world in installed geothermal capacity with power plants in eight states, and exploration for new electrical-grade geothermal systems is ongoing. Geothermal systems at depth may be identified at the surface by hot springs and fumaroles or by minerals produced by thermal fluids (hydrothermal alteration and hot spring deposits). Northern Fish Lake Valley, Nevada hosts two previously known geothermal fields. This study expanded prospects and identified new areas for future exploration within the valley. We demonstrated the potential for using remote sensing data to evaluate regions that are not well explored. We used visible, near, and shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5. ??m) remote sensing data to map surficial mineralogy. Data were collected by three airborne imaging spectrometer instruments, AVIRIS, HyMap, and ProSpecTIR, each over different parts of Fish Lake Valley. Minerals were identified using diagnostic spectral features. We verified remote sensing results in the field using a portable spectrometer to confirm agreement between field and remote spectra.The discovery of additional geothermal resources in Fish Lake Valley may provide the necessary added incentive to build costly transmission lines to this remote location. We used remote sensing data to delineate four new targets for future geothermal exploration in northern Fish Lake Valley. Two new areas of sinter and travertine deposits were identified northwest of the playa, likely deposited around fault-controlled hot springs during the Pleistocene when the water table was higher. Previously undocumented Miocene crystalline travertine was identified within the Emigrant Hills. Argillic alteration was mapped within ranges, where thermal fluids were likely discharged from faults to alter rhyolite tuff. Here we explain our data processing techniques which include a novel decorrelation stretch designed for geothermal prospecting, and discuss how remote sensing results guided our interpretation of the region's geothermal systems. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of burned areas in Rond\^{o}nia State, Brazil during the years 2000 to 2011 and evaluate the burned area maps. A Linear Spectral Mixture Model (\{LSMM\}) was applied to \{MODIS\} surface reflectance images to originate the burned areas maps, which were validated with \{TM\}/Landsat 5 and \{ETM\}+/Landsat 7 images and field data acquired in August 2013. The validation presented a correlation ranging from 67\% to 96\% with an average value of 86\%. The lower correlation values are related to the distinct spatial resolutions of the \{MODIS\} and \{TM\}/\{ETM\}+ sensors because small burn scars are not detected in \{MODIS\} images and higher spatial correlations are related to the presence of large fires, which are better identified in \{MODIS\}, increasing the accuracy of the mapping methodology. In addition, the 12-year burned area maps of Rond\^{o}nia indicate that fires, as a general pattern, occur in areas that have already been converted to some land use, such as vegetal extraction, large animal livestock areas or diversified permanent crops. Furthermore, during the analyzed period, land use conversion associated with climatic events significantly influenced the occurrence of fire in Rond\^{o}nia and amplified its impacts.},

abstract = {Landsat images are highly preferred to images by MODIS for producing evapotranspiration (ET) maps for specific land use types because of their higher resolution (30 m). However, Landsat images are potentially available only each 16 days, and, with the expected failure of Landsat 5 sometime within the next five years and the questionable likelihood of a thermal sensor on Landsat 8 scheduled for launch in 2012, the prospect of images from Landsat that are useful for application with energy balance determination of evapotranspiration (ET) is less than bright. Therefore, more use of coarse resolution satellite images, such as 1 Ion thermal images from MODIS, will occur. One advantage of MODIS satellites is that images having view angle < -150 are potentially available about each four to five days. Application of METRIC energy balance processes along the Middle Rio Grande of New Mexico using MODIS imagery indicates that one can successfully reproduce monthly and annual ET estimates that were obtained using Landsat imagery. However, spatial fidelity is highly degraded. This paper compares ET images for the Rio Grande region as produced by both MODIS and by Landsat.},

abstract = {Visible near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has long been used for geothermal exploration. Specific focus on the TIR region (8-12. $\mu$m) has resulted in major-rock-forming mineral classes being identified and their areal percentages to be more easily mapped due in part to the linear mixing behavior of TIR emission. To understand the mineral compositional and thermal distribution of active geothermal surfaces systems, hyperspectral TIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) airborne sensor were acquired over the Salton Sea, CA geothermal fields by The Aerospace Corporation on March 26, 2009 and April 6, 2010. SEBASS collects 128 wavelength channels at \~{}. 1. m spatial resolution. Such high resolution data are rarely available for this type of scientific analysis and enabled the identification of rare mineral assemblages associated with the geothermally-active areas. One surface unit with a unique spectrum, believed to be a magnesium sulfate of unknown hydration state, was identified for the first time in the SEBASS data. The abundance and distribution of this mineral varied between 2009 and 2010 likely due to the precipitation conditions. Data obtained by the SEBASS sensor were also regressed to the 32 channel spectral resolution of the Mineral and Gas Identifier (MAGI) airborne sensor in order to test sensitivity limits. At this lower spectral resolution, all surface minerals were still effectively identified and therefore validated data at MAGI resolution are still very effective for accurate surface compositional mapping. A similar approach used at active geothermal areas in other semi-arid regions around the world has the potential to better characterize transient mineralogy, identify "indicators minerals", understand the influence of surface and ground water, and ultimately to locate new geothermal targets for future exploration. Furthermore, new Mineral and Gas Identification (MAGI) data serve as an excellent precursor for future spaceborne TIR data such as the system proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) instrument.

abstract = {The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Alaska Energy Author- ity are jointly funding a project to re-assess the resource potential of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. Phase one of this project has included airborne thermal infrared remote sensing for mapping surface geothermal phenomena and assess- ment of the resource potential of the system. Thermal infrared and optical images were acquired over the Pilgrim Hot Springs site and neighboring regions during two surveys in fall 2010 and spring 2011. Thermal images providing information on land surface temperature at a spatial resolution better than 1.3 meters were acquired using a FLIR A320 camera operating in the broad 7.5â13 Âµm wavelength region. Fieldwork during the airborne surveys gathered ground calibration and validation data such as hot spring, ground, and at- mospheric temperatures, atmospheric humidity and the precise GPS locations of low-emissivity ground targets. We applied atmospheric correction, registration and mosaicking to generate seamless maps of calibrated surface temperature across the study area. Analysis of this data enables delineation of the main geothermal features of the system including hot springs, pools, and areas of thermally anomalous ground. Using a thermal-budget approach the thermal heat flux sustaining surface geothermal waters was estimated from the fall and spring FLIR data. Calculated heat fluxes and outflow rates assuming a hot spring temperature of 81Â°C is significantly higher than previous field-based methods. Our work demonstrates that airborne thermal infrared remote sensing provides a rapid and relatively low cost method for mapping and quantitative assessment of undeveloped spring-dominated geothermal systems in Alaska},

abstract = {We present the first quantitative representation of the intensity of Yellowstone National Park's surficial geothermal activity mapped continuously in space. A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km2 landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0??W m- 2 up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94??W m- 2 (at the 28.5??m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r = 0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone's famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) are developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA is responsible for building and launching the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185. km swath with a 30. m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15. m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100. m resolution over a 185. km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite "Landsat 8" following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Thermal activity monitoring in and around active volcanic areas using remote sensing is an essential part of volcanology nowadays. Three identical approaches were used for thermal activity exploration at Aso volcanic area in Japan using Landsat ETM+images. First, the conventional methods for hydrothermal alteration mapping were applied to find the most active thermal region after exploring geothermal indicator minerals. Second, we found some thermally highly anomalous regions around Nakadake crater using land surface temperature estimation. Then, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation was used for estimating and also monitoring radiative heat flux (RHF) from the most active region of about 8km2 in and around Nakadake crater in the central part of the Aso volcano. To fulfill the required parameter in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux, the NDVI (Normalized differential vegetation index) method was used for spectral emissivity, and the mono-window algorithm was used for land surface temperature of this study area. The NDVI value was used to divide land-cover in the study area into four types: water, bare ground, mixed and vegetated land. The bare land was found within the most active region. Vegetation coverage area showed an inverse relationship with total RHF in this study as health of thermally stressed vegetation supports this relationship. The spatial distribution of spectral emissivity ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 in our study. Land surface temperature was estimated using a mono-window algorithm and was highest LST in 2008 and lowest in 2011. The results of RHF showed that the highest pixel RHF was found to be about 296W/m2 in 2008. Total RHF was obtained of about 607MW in 2002 and the lowest was about 354MW in 2008. The RHF anomaly area was found the highest in 2002 and was lowest in 2011. The highest total heat discharge rate (HDR) obtained about 3918MW in 2002 and lowest total HDR about 2289MW in 2008 from this study area. But in the case of Nakadake crater alone, the higher thermal activity was observed in 2008 and was less in 2004. The study showed that Landsat thermal infrared is the best option for thermal activity exploration and monitoring at Aso volcano as well as in any active volcano region considering high efficiency and low cost.

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is an important characteristic of the land surface. Because multi-spectral bands are used to describe the land surface, an approach has to be established to characterize the surface spatial heterogeneity from multi-spectral remote-sensing observations. This work aims at quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of cropland using varigorams for multi-temporal NDVI, near infrared (NIR) and red reflectance. A concept of mean length variability is proposed to compare the difference in spatial heterogeneity detected by variables with different magnitudes. The important temporal changes in spatial heterogeneity observed by NDVI, NIR and red bands over cropland are a result of changes in the fraction of vegetation cover. The results indicate the following: (1) the NIR and red variables detect a similar spatial heterogeneity of the cropland with similar values of the mean length variability before the sowing of crops; (2) the NDVI, NIR and red values capture different degrees of spatial heterogeneity when vegetation cover is low; (3) over medium vegetation cover, the NDVI and NIR values capture similar spatial heterogeneity, which is low compared to the red band due to the homogeneity of soil; and (4) the spatial heterogeneity quantified by the NIR value is more heterogeneous than those of the NDVI and red values when vegetation cover is high. The red reflectance is sensitive to soil properties while the NIR reflectance responds to vegetation. The spatial heterogeneity of red reflectance decreases and that of the NIR reflectance increases with the growth of vegetation. The NDVI value shows the greatest heterogeneity in the early stage of crop growth. With an increase in the image pixel size, the spatial heterogeneity quantified by the mean length variability of the NDVI, NIR and red variables tends to be the same. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Alaska Energy Author- ity are jointly funding a project to re-assess the resource potential of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. Phase one of this project has included airborne thermal infrared remote sensing for mapping surface geothermal phenomena and assess- ment of the resource potential of the system. Thermal infrared and optical images were acquired over the Pilgrim Hot Springs site and neighboring regions during two surveys in fall 2010 and spring 2011. Thermal images providing information on land surface temperature at a spatial resolution better than 1.3 meters were acquired using a FLIR A320 camera operating in the broad 7.5â13 Âµm wavelength region. Fieldwork during the airborne surveys gathered ground calibration and validation data such as hot spring, ground, and at- mospheric temperatures, atmospheric humidity and the precise GPS locations of low-emissivity ground targets. We applied atmospheric correction, registration and mosaicking to generate seamless maps of calibrated surface temperature across the study area. Analysis of this data enables delineation of the main geothermal features of the system including hot springs, pools, and areas of thermally anomalous ground. Using a thermal-budget approach the thermal heat flux sustaining surface geothermal waters was estimated from the fall and spring FLIR data. Calculated heat fluxes and outflow rates assuming a hot spring temperature of 81Â°C is significantly higher than previous field-based methods. Our work demonstrates that airborne thermal infrared remote sensing provides a rapid and relatively low cost method for mapping and quantitative assessment of undeveloped spring-dominated geothermal systems in Alaska},

abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of image pansharpening on Vegetation Indices (VIs), and found that pansharpening was able to downscale single-date and multi-temporal Landsat 8 VI data without introducing significant distortions in VI values. Four fast pansharpening methodsâFast Intensity-Hue-Saturation (FIHS), Brovey Transform (BT), Additive Wavelet Transform (AWT), and Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation (SFIM)âand two VIsâNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Simple Ratio (SR)âwere tested. The NDVI and SR formulas were both found to cause some spatial information loss in the pansharpened multispectral (MS) bands, and this spatial information loss from VI transformations was not specific to Landsat 8 imagery (it will occur for any type of imagery). BT, SFIM, and other similar pansharpening methods that inject spatial information from the panchromatic (Pan) band by multiplication, lose all of the injected spatial information after the VI calculations. FIHS, AWT, and other similar pansharpening methods that inject spatial information by addition, lose some spatial information from the Pan band after VI calculations as well. Nevertheless, for all of the single- and multi-date VI images, the FIHS and AWT pansharpened images were more similar to the higher resolution reference data than the unsharpened VI images were, indicating that pansharpening was effective in downscaling the VI data. FIHS best enhanced the spectral and spatial information of the single-date and multi-date VI images, followed by AWT, and neither significantly over- or under-estimated VI values.},

To quantify the potential for ResourceSat-1 to satisfy some of the needs of the remote sensing community, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values derived from Landsat-5 were compared to NDVI values derived from ResourceSat-1. An intercalibration equation that converts ResourceSat-1 NDVI values to equivalent Landsat-5 NDVI values was derived thereby enabling direct comparison between the two sensors. Comparisons were made using imagery spanning a 3-year time period. Prior to intercalibration, NDVI values were highly correlated (mean R 2 > 0.73) but statistically different (P < 0.001).

abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an important technique in the exploration of geothermal resources. In this study, a geothermal survey is conducted in Tengchong area of Yunnan province in China using TIR data from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor. Based on radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and emissivity calculation, a simple but efficient single channel algorithm with acceptable precision is applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of study area. The LST anomalous areas with temperature about 4-10 K higher than background area are discovered. Four geothermal areas are identified with the discussion of geothermal mechanism and the further analysis of regional geologic structure. The research reveals that the distribution of geothermal areas is consistent with the fault development in study area. Magmatism contributes abundant thermal source to study area and the faults provide thermal channels for heat transfer from interior earth to land surface and facilitate the present of geothermal anomalies. Finally, we conclude that TIR remote sensing is a cost-effective technique to detect LST anomalies. Combining TIR remote sensing with geological analysis and the understanding of geothermal mechanism is an accurate and efficient approach to geothermal area detection. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

These emissions detected in sensorâs band 10 (10.60â11.19 Âµm) have here been quantified in terms of radiant power, to confirm reports of the actual volcanic processes operating at the time of image acquisition, and to form an initial assessment of the TIRS in its volcanic observation capabilities. Data from band 11 have been neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable at the time of writing. At the instant of image acquisition, the thermal emission of the volcano was found to be 345 MW. This value is shown to be on the same order of magnitude as similarly timed NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer thermal observations. Given its unique characteristics, the TIRS shows much potential for providing useful, detailed and accurate volcanic observations in the future.},

abstract = {We define volcanic unrest as the deviation from the background or baseline behaviour of a volcano towards a behaviour which is a cause for concern in the short-term because it might prelude an eruption. When unrest is preceded by periods of quiescence over centuries or millennia it is particularly difficult to foresee how a volcano might behave in the short-term. As a consequence, one of the most important problems is to assess whether unrest will culminate in an eruption or not. Here, we review and evaluate global unrest reports of the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program (GVP) between January 2000 and July 2011. The aim of the evaluation is to establish the nature and length of unrest activity to test whether there are common temporal patterns in unrest indicators and whether there is a link between the length of inter-eruptive periods and unrest duration across different volcano types. A database is created from the reported information on unrest at 228 volcanoes. The data is categorised into pre-eruptive or non-eruptive unrest indicators at four different subaerial volcano types and submarine volcanoes as defined by the GVP. Unrest timelines demonstrate how unrest evolved over time and highlight different classes of unrest including reawakening, pulsatory, prolonged, sporadic and intra-eruptive unrest. Statistical tests indicate that pre-eruptive unrest duration was different across different volcano types. 50\% of stratovolcanoes erupted after about one month of reported unrest. At large calderas this median average duration of pre-eruptive unrest was about twice as long. At almost five months, shield volcanoes had a significantly longer unrest period before the onset of eruption, compared to both large calderas and stratovolcanoes. At complex volcanoes, eruptive unrest was short lived with only a median average duration of two days. We find that there is only a poor correlation between the length of the inter-eruptive period and unrest duration in the data; statistical significance was only detected for the pair-wise comparison of non-eruptive unrest at large calderas and stratovolcanoes. Results indicate that volcanoes with long periods of quiescence between eruptions will not necessarily undergo prolonged periods of unrest before their next eruption.Our findings may have implications for hazard assessment, risk mitigation and scenario planning during future unrest crises. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Visible near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has long been used for geothermal exploration. Specific focus on the TIR region (8-12. $\mu$m) has resulted in major-rock-forming mineral classes being identified and their areal percentages to be more easily mapped due in part to the linear mixing behavior of TIR emission. To understand the mineral compositional and thermal distribution of active geothermal surfaces systems, hyperspectral TIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) airborne sensor were acquired over the Salton Sea, CA geothermal fields by The Aerospace Corporation on March 26, 2009 and April 6, 2010. SEBASS collects 128 wavelength channels at \~{}. 1. m spatial resolution. Such high resolution data are rarely available for this type of scientific analysis and enabled the identification of rare mineral assemblages associated with the geothermally-active areas. One surface unit with a unique spectrum, believed to be a magnesium sulfate of unknown hydration state, was identified for the first time in the SEBASS data. The abundance and distribution of this mineral varied between 2009 and 2010 likely due to the precipitation conditions. Data obtained by the SEBASS sensor were also regressed to the 32 channel spectral resolution of the Mineral and Gas Identifier (MAGI) airborne sensor in order to test sensitivity limits. At this lower spectral resolution, all surface minerals were still effectively identified and therefore validated data at MAGI resolution are still very effective for accurate surface compositional mapping. A similar approach used at active geothermal areas in other semi-arid regions around the world has the potential to better characterize transient mineralogy, identify "indicators minerals", understand the influence of surface and ground water, and ultimately to locate new geothermal targets for future exploration. Furthermore, new Mineral and Gas Identification (MAGI) data serve as an excellent precursor for future spaceborne TIR data such as the system proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) instrument.

abstract = {Thermal activity monitoring in and around active volcanic areas using remote sensing is an essential part of volcanology nowadays. Three identical approaches were used for thermal activity exploration at Aso volcanic area in Japan using Landsat ETM+images. First, the conventional methods for hydrothermal alteration mapping were applied to find the most active thermal region after exploring geothermal indicator minerals. Second, we found some thermally highly anomalous regions around Nakadake crater using land surface temperature estimation. Then, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation was used for estimating and also monitoring radiative heat flux (RHF) from the most active region of about 8km2 in and around Nakadake crater in the central part of the Aso volcano. To fulfill the required parameter in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux, the NDVI (Normalized differential vegetation index) method was used for spectral emissivity, and the mono-window algorithm was used for land surface temperature of this study area. The NDVI value was used to divide land-cover in the study area into four types: water, bare ground, mixed and vegetated land. The bare land was found within the most active region. Vegetation coverage area showed an inverse relationship with total RHF in this study as health of thermally stressed vegetation supports this relationship. The spatial distribution of spectral emissivity ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 in our study. Land surface temperature was estimated using a mono-window algorithm and was highest LST in 2008 and lowest in 2011. The results of RHF showed that the highest pixel RHF was found to be about 296W/m2 in 2008. Total RHF was obtained of about 607MW in 2002 and the lowest was about 354MW in 2008. The RHF anomaly area was found the highest in 2002 and was lowest in 2011. The highest total heat discharge rate (HDR) obtained about 3918MW in 2002 and lowest total HDR about 2289MW in 2008 from this study area. But in the case of Nakadake crater alone, the higher thermal activity was observed in 2008 and was less in 2004. The study showed that Landsat thermal infrared is the best option for thermal activity exploration and monitoring at Aso volcano as well as in any active volcano region considering high efficiency and low cost.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the effects of image pansharpening on Vegetation Indices (VIs), and found that pansharpening was able to downscale single-date and multi-temporal Landsat 8 VI data without introducing significant distortions in VI values. Four fast pansharpening methodsâFast Intensity-Hue-Saturation (FIHS), Brovey Transform (BT), Additive Wavelet Transform (AWT), and Smoothing Filter-based Intensity Modulation (SFIM)âand two VIsâNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Simple Ratio (SR)âwere tested. The NDVI and SR formulas were both found to cause some spatial information loss in the pansharpened multispectral (MS) bands, and this spatial information loss from VI transformations was not specific to Landsat 8 imagery (it will occur for any type of imagery). BT, SFIM, and other similar pansharpening methods that inject spatial information from the panchromatic (Pan) band by multiplication, lose all of the injected spatial information after the VI calculations. FIHS, AWT, and other similar pansharpening methods that inject spatial information by addition, lose some spatial information from the Pan band after VI calculations as well. Nevertheless, for all of the single- and multi-date VI images, the FIHS and AWT pansharpened images were more similar to the higher resolution reference data than the unsharpened VI images were, indicating that pansharpening was effective in downscaling the VI data. FIHS best enhanced the spectral and spatial information of the single-date and multi-date VI images, followed by AWT, and neither significantly over- or under-estimated VI values.},

abstract = {Landsat-8, the latest in the Landsat series of satellites, was launched on February 11, 2013 and carries on board the Operational Land Imager (OLI) as one of its payloads. The satelliteâs mission is to continue the long history of moderate resolution imaging of the Landsat program. The OLI follows the highly successful Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 in continuing to populate a global archive of Earth images that dates back to 1972. The design of the Landsat-8 instruments is a significant departure from earlier Landsats. The OLI is a pushbroom instrument; all previous recent Landsat instruments were electromechanical (whiskbroom) instruments. OLI also has two new spectral bands and refined bandpasses; the thermal imaging capability on Landsat-8 is in a separate instrument. The pushbroom design provides significantly better signal to noise performance than historically available, but at the expense of circa 70,000 detectors versus the 100 or so on previous instruments. The large focal plane and large number of detectors makes detector to detector relative calibration more challenging, increasing the propensity for banding and striping in imagery. On-board radiometric calibration devices include a shutter to measure the dark levels, a full aperture solar panel for calibration against the sun, and multiple sets of lamps for short-term stability monitoring. Early results from the on-board calibration devices indicate that the OLI is outperforming the Landsat-7 instrument in signal-to-noise ratio by an order of magnitude, consistent with pre-launch measurements. Over the first five months, the instrument is stable to within 0.7\%, as measured by the lamps and solar diffuser. A relative calibration (detector-to-detector) and a linearization parameter update have been performed that reduce visible striping; with this update, the residual striping has been reduced by half in all OLI bands.},

According to the International Geographic Data Committee (IGDC), coastlines are one of the most important environmental heritages on the earthâs surface. In the coastal areas, main challenge is to understand the present coastline dynamics and to predict its future developments. Therefore the coastal zone monitoring is an essential process for sustainable coastal management and environmental protection. Shoreline extraction is an important issue for coastal zone monitoring. In this study, efficiency of two different methods for detection of coastline features from satellite images, which cover Lakeland region of Turkey, has been tested. Firstly, object based classification method (OBC) has been used to extract shoreline automatically. Developed process based rule set extracts coastline as a vector file from satellite imagery. As a second method, support vector machine (SVM) algorithm has been used to extract coastline. For the application of these two different methods, Landsat 8 data have been used. The results of these two automatic coastline extraction methods were compared with the results derived from manual digitization process. Random control points over the coastline were used in the evaluation. Results showed that both methods have a sub-pixel accuracy to detect coastline features from Landsat 8 imagery.},

Remote sensing is a component of the current geothermal monitoring plan. Landsat satellite data have a substantial historical archive and will continue to be collected into the future, making it the only available thermal imagery for histori- cal analysis and long-term monitoring of geothermal areas in the entirety of YNP. Landsat imagery from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors was used to examine change trajectories for terrestrial emittance among spatial groupings from 1986 to 2007. Trajectories of locations with known change events were also examined. Relationships between the spatial groupings and several change vectors (distance to geologic faults, distance to large water bodies, and distance to earthquake swarms) were explored. The analysis showed the stron- gest relationship between absolute difference in terrestrial emittance and earthquake swarms, with 34\% of the variation explained. Certain known change events were reflected in the change trajectories, while the Landsat imagery was not able to detect other known events. This suggests that Landsat imagery might be a useful tool for monitoring geothermal responses in YNP, but cannot be expected to suffice as the sole monitoring tool.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of burned areas in Rond\^{o}nia State, Brazil during the years 2000 to 2011 and evaluate the burned area maps. A Linear Spectral Mixture Model (LSMM) was applied to MODIS surface reflectance images to originate the burned areas maps, which were validated with TM/Landsat 5 and ETM+/Landsat 7 images and field data acquired in August 2013. The validation presented a correlation ranging from 67\% to 96\% with an average value of 86\%. The lower correlation values are related to the distinct spatial resolutions of the MODIS and TM/ETM+ sensors because small burn scars are not detected in MODIS images and higher spatial correlations are related to the presence of large fires, which are better identified in MODIS, increasing the accuracy of the mapping methodology. In addition, the 12-year burned area maps of Rond\^{o}nia indicate that fires, as a general pattern, occur in areas that have already been converted to some land use, such as vegetal extraction, large animal livestock areas or diversified permanent crops. Furthermore, during the analyzed period, land use conversion associated with climatic events significantly influenced the occurrence of fire in Rond\^{o}nia and amplified its impacts},

Simple and (semi) empirical approaches have been applied to estimate CWR: the first one is called Kc-NDVI method, based on the correlation between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the crop coefficient (Kc); the second one is the analytical approach based on the direct application of the Penman-Monteith equation with reflectance-based estimates of canopy biophysical variables, such as surface albedo (r), leaf area index (LAI) and crop height (hc). A time series of high spatial resolution RapidEye (REIS), SPOT4 (HRVIR1) and Landsat 8 (OLI) images acquired during the 2012/2013 agricultural season has been used to assess the spatial and temporal variability of crop evapotranspiration ETc and biophysical variables. The validation using the dual crop coefficient approach (Kcb) showed that the satellite-based estimates of daily ETc were in good agreement with ground-based ETc, i.e., R2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 0.79 versus R2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 0.89 for the Kc-NDVI, respective of the analytical approach. The assessment of irrigation performance in terms of adequacy between water requirements and allocations showed that CWR were much larger than allocated surface water for the entire area, with this difference being small at the beginning of the growing season. Even smaller differences were observed between surface water allocations and Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) throughout the irrigation season. Finally, surface water allocations were rather close to Net Irrigation Water Requirements (NIWR).},

abstract = {Visible near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has long been used for geothermal exploration. Specific focus on the TIR region (8-12. $\mu$m) has resulted in major-rock-forming mineral classes being identified and their areal percentages to be more easily mapped due in part to the linear mixing behavior of TIR emission. To understand the mineral compositional and thermal distribution of active geothermal surfaces systems, hyperspectral TIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) airborne sensor were acquired over the Salton Sea, CA geothermal fields by The Aerospace Corporation on March 26, 2009 and April 6, 2010. SEBASS collects 128 wavelength channels at \~{}. 1. m spatial resolution. Such high resolution data are rarely available for this type of scientific analysis and enabled the identification of rare mineral assemblages associated with the geothermally-active areas. One surface unit with a unique spectrum, believed to be a magnesium sulfate of unknown hydration state, was identified for the first time in the SEBASS data. The abundance and distribution of this mineral varied between 2009 and 2010 likely due to the precipitation conditions. Data obtained by the SEBASS sensor were also regressed to the 32 channel spectral resolution of the Mineral and Gas Identifier (MAGI) airborne sensor in order to test sensitivity limits. At this lower spectral resolution, all surface minerals were still effectively identified and therefore validated data at MAGI resolution are still very effective for accurate surface compositional mapping. A similar approach used at active geothermal areas in other semi-arid regions around the world has the potential to better characterize transient mineralogy, identify "indicators minerals", understand the influence of surface and ground water, and ultimately to locate new geothermal targets for future exploration. Furthermore, new Mineral and Gas Identification (MAGI) data serve as an excellent precursor for future spaceborne TIR data such as the system proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) instrument.
