abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) anomalies where the temperatures are higher than the background can be used to detect areas with high potential of geothermal resource. This paper focused on mapping the variability of geothermal resource through a combination of Thermal infrared remote sensing (TIR) and borehole data with temperature logging in Hokkaido Island, northern Japan. The result showed that that the zones with the highest geothermal potential in Hokkaido Island are located in the volcanic areas. Moreover, similarity between the distributions of LST and the temperature at a great depth was identified.

@article{Dickson1988Geothermics,
abstract = {The first industrial (3.5 MW) geothermoelectric power-plant installed in the developing countries was that of Path\'{e}, Mexico, in 1964. A further 75 MW geothermoelectric were added in 1973, again in Mexico, at Cerro Prieto. Other countries later followed the Mexican example, with the result that the geothermoelectric capacity installed in the developing nations increased rapidly from 462 MW in 1979 to 1495 MW in 1984. At the moment (1988) the total geothermoelectric capacity in the developing countries is 1949.7 MW, distributed as follows 2Philippines894 MWMexico700 MWIndonesia142 MWEl Salvador95 MWKenya45 MWNicaragua35 MWTurkey20.6 MWChina17.3 MWArgentina0.6 MWZambia0.2 MW For the moment there are very few non-electric applications of geothermal heat in the developing countries. The most interesting examples in Africa are found in the circum-Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Tunisia) and in Asia in China and Turkey. There are no known plants for the direct use of geothermal heat in Latin-America. The progress of geothermal R\&D is very satisfactory in the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia, fairly satisfactory in Kenya, Ethiopia and some Central-American countries such as El Salvador and Nicaragua, but still at very early stages in most of the other countries. Several nations with favourable geological conditions for the development of geothermal resources have just begun, or have still to begin, their reconnaissance work.},
