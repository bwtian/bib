@article{Watson2008,
abstract = {We present the first quantitative representation of the intensity of Yellowstone National Park's surficial geothermal activity mapped continuously in space. A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km2 landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0??W m- 2 up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94??W m- 2 (at the 28.5??m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r = 0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone's famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of burned areas in Rond\^{o}nia State, Brazil during the years 2000 to 2011 and evaluate the burned area maps. A Linear Spectral Mixture Model (\{LSMM\}) was applied to \{MODIS\} surface reflectance images to originate the burned areas maps, which were validated with \{TM\}/Landsat 5 and \{ETM\}+/Landsat 7 images and field data acquired in August 2013. The validation presented a correlation ranging from 67\% to 96\% with an average value of 86\%. The lower correlation values are related to the distinct spatial resolutions of the \{MODIS\} and \{TM\}/\{ETM\}+ sensors because small burn scars are not detected in \{MODIS\} images and higher spatial correlations are related to the presence of large fires, which are better identified in \{MODIS\}, increasing the accuracy of the mapping methodology. In addition, the 12-year burned area maps of Rond\^{o}nia indicate that fires, as a general pattern, occur in areas that have already been converted to some land use, such as vegetal extraction, large animal livestock areas or diversified permanent crops. Furthermore, during the analyzed period, land use conversion associated with climatic events significantly influenced the occurrence of fire in Rond\^{o}nia and amplified its impacts.},
