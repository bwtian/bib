abstract = {We analyse shortwave infrared thermal data of the phase 1 eruption of Unzen Volcano (Japan) extracted from eight nighttime Thematic Mapper (TM) images taken from the Landsat 5 satellite between October 1991 and November 1992. We identify two discrete regions of the dome that were heated to high temperature by the ongoing eruptive activity; a fumarolically heated region and an area associated with the effusion of new lava. We concentrate analysis on the fumarolically heated region and investigate the relationships between parameters derived from the infrared radiance data and the nature of the fumarolic gas and magma fluxes. Temporal variations in the parameters derived from the radiance data closely follow those observed in the measured rate of magma effusion. The positive correlation observed between the fumarolically driven shortwave infrared flux and the magma discharge rate (r2 = 0.64) indicates that degassing occurred efficiently and in proportion to the amount of magma supplied. Over our monitoring period, the data suggest that gas accumulation within the edifice did not occur, this conclusion agreeing with a previous finding obtained using correlation spectrometer (COSPEC) analysis of SO2 flux rates. A positive correlation (r2 = 0.56) was also found between the mean radiance of the pixels in the fumarolically heated region and the overall size of that region. This suggests a potential mechanism whereby, when gas pressure within the edifice increased, excess gas escaped through additional pathways to the surface as well through an increased flux at the main fumarolic vents.},

abstract = {Mud volcanoes are relatively small spatter cones that erupt water-laden mud and gases, and occur throughout the world. For many mud volcanoes, the eruption of warm mud (10-40°C) can be detected with high-resolution thermal satellite imagery. We demonstrate the utility of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery for thermal monitoring of active mud volcanism. We constrain the temperature and area of active mud discharge and estimate surface heat flux for two isolated mud volcanoes in the Copper River Basin, Alaska using Band 6 (10.4-12.5 $\mu$m). The heat flux results span a wide range due to uncertainties in the environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition, but can be constrained to be less than 0.24 MW for each of the two mud volcanoes considering previously published field measurements. With this higher-resolution Band 6 on the ETM+ sensor, as well as the high-resolution thermal bands on the ASTER sensor, reliable monitoring of mud volcanism on this scale is possible for the first time. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Landsat-8 satellite of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in April 2013. Just weeks after it entered active service, its sensors observed activity at Paluweh Volcano, Indonesia. Given that the image acquired was in the daytime, its shortwave infrared observations were contaminated with reflected solar radiation; however, those of the satellite’s Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) show thermal emission from the volcano’s summit and flanks. These emissions detected in sensor’s band 10 (10.60–11.19 µm) have here been quantified in terms of radiant power, to confirm reports of the actual volcanic processes operating at the time of image acquisition, and to form an initial assessment of the TIRS in its volcanic observation capabilities. Data from band 11 have been neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable at the time of writing. At the instant of image acquisition, the thermal emission of the volcano was found to be 345 MW. This value is shown to be on the same order of magnitude as similarly timed NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer thermal observations. Given its unique characteristics, the TIRS shows much potential for providing useful, detailed and accurate volcanic observations in the future.},

abstract = {Thermal activity monitoring in and around active volcanic areas using remote sensing is an essential part of volcanology nowadays. Three identical approaches were used for thermal activity exploration at Aso volcanic area in Japan using Landsat ETM+images. First, the conventional methods for hydrothermal alteration mapping were applied to find the most active thermal region after exploring geothermal indicator minerals. Second, we found some thermally highly anomalous regions around Nakadake crater using land surface temperature estimation. Then, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation was used for estimating and also monitoring radiative heat flux (RHF) from the most active region of about 8km2 in and around Nakadake crater in the central part of the Aso volcano. To fulfill the required parameter in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux, the NDVI (Normalized differential vegetation index) method was used for spectral emissivity, and the mono-window algorithm was used for land surface temperature of this study area. The NDVI value was used to divide land-cover in the study area into four types: water, bare ground, mixed and vegetated land. The bare land was found within the most active region. Vegetation coverage area showed an inverse relationship with total RHF in this study as health of thermally stressed vegetation supports this relationship. The spatial distribution of spectral emissivity ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 in our study. Land surface temperature was estimated using a mono-window algorithm and was highest LST in 2008 and lowest in 2011. The results of RHF showed that the highest pixel RHF was found to be about 296W/m2 in 2008. Total RHF was obtained of about 607MW in 2002 and the lowest was about 354MW in 2008. The RHF anomaly area was found the highest in 2002 and was lowest in 2011. The highest total heat discharge rate (HDR) obtained about 3918MW in 2002 and lowest total HDR about 2289MW in 2008 from this study area. But in the case of Nakadake crater alone, the higher thermal activity was observed in 2008 and was less in 2004. The study showed that Landsat thermal infrared is the best option for thermal activity exploration and monitoring at Aso volcano as well as in any active volcano region considering high efficiency and low cost.},

abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) are developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA is responsible for building and launching the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185. km swath with a 30. m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15. m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100. m resolution over a 185. km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite "Landsat 8" following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Visible near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has long been used for geothermal exploration. Specific focus on the TIR region (8-12. $\mu$m) has resulted in major-rock-forming mineral classes being identified and their areal percentages to be more easily mapped due in part to the linear mixing behavior of TIR emission. To understand the mineral compositional and thermal distribution of active geothermal surfaces systems, hyperspectral TIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) airborne sensor were acquired over the Salton Sea, CA geothermal fields by The Aerospace Corporation on March 26, 2009 and April 6, 2010. SEBASS collects 128 wavelength channels at \~{}. 1. m spatial resolution. Such high resolution data are rarely available for this type of scientific analysis and enabled the identification of rare mineral assemblages associated with the geothermally-active areas. One surface unit with a unique spectrum, believed to be a magnesium sulfate of unknown hydration state, was identified for the first time in the SEBASS data. The abundance and distribution of this mineral varied between 2009 and 2010 likely due to the precipitation conditions. Data obtained by the SEBASS sensor were also regressed to the 32 channel spectral resolution of the Mineral and Gas Identifier (MAGI) airborne sensor in order to test sensitivity limits. At this lower spectral resolution, all surface minerals were still effectively identified and therefore validated data at MAGI resolution are still very effective for accurate surface compositional mapping. A similar approach used at active geothermal areas in other semi-arid regions around the world has the potential to better characterize transient mineralogy, identify "indicators minerals", understand the influence of surface and ground water, and ultimately to locate new geothermal targets for future exploration. Furthermore, new Mineral and Gas Identification (MAGI) data serve as an excellent precursor for future spaceborne TIR data such as the system proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) instrument. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Meer2014IJAEOG,
abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25–30°C per kilometer depth, however in active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150°C per kilometer depth can be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hot water is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles are evidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling and drying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper we review the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from the traditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirect detection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat fluxes, geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to published remote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions, mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from the La Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between various surface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute to exploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached full maturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework. A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and the present contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number of question lines: ‘how reproducible are remote sensing products’, ‘can long term monitoring of geothermal systems be achieved’ and ‘do surface manifestations link to subsurface features’?},

abstract = {Geothermal resources exist on the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribal Lands (PLPTL) in northwestern Nevada. We compiled numerous indicators of these resources into a geographic information system along with concurrent investigative results. This effort required acquisition and analysis of spaceborne multispectral and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for early-stage geothermal exploration. We identified minerals such as alunite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite through analysis of hyperspectral data indicating regions of hydrothermally altered rock associated with areas of geothermal potential. Tertiary volcanic and granitic rocks also contain these indicator minerals. Quaternary environments displayed gypsum-bearing evaporite crusts that we postulate were deposited by sulfate-rich thermal waters. Throughout the PLPTL, tufa towers and tufa shoreline deposits are extensively distributed as remnants of paleo-lake Lahontan. Based on measured spectra of calcium carbonate, we mapped tufa towers elucidating the strike direction of associated faults. Additionally, we correlated remotely-derived maps of shoreline tufa deposits with climate-related changes in lake level. Our mapping results helped guide detailed exploration efforts to areas with the most geothermal potential. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Landsat satellite data have a substantial historical archive and will continue to be collected into the future, making it the only available thermal imagery for histori- cal analysis and long-term monitoring of geothermal areas in the entirety of YNP. Landsat imagery from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors was used to examine change trajectories for terrestrial emittance among spatial groupings from 1986 to 2007. Trajectories of locations with known change events were also examined. Relationships between the spatial groupings and several change vectors (distance to geologic faults, distance to large water bodies, and distance to earthquake swarms) were explored. The analysis showed the stron- gest relationship between absolute difference in terrestrial emittance and earthquake swarms, with 34\% of the variation explained. Certain known change events were reflected in the change trajectories, while the Landsat imagery was not able to detect other known events. This suggests that Landsat imagery might be a useful tool for monitoring geothermal responses in YNP, but cannot be expected to suffice as the sole monitoring tool.},

abstract = {Multispectral satellite data recorded in the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) region have been used to estimate temperatures of hot volcanic features such as fumaroles and lava bodies. This has required the assumption that thermal distributions across the surfaces in question can be adequately represented by a very few (usually two) temperature components. We investigate here the applicability of such simple descriptions to fumarole fields, an important class of thermal phenomena. Our surface temperature surveys, conducted at Momotombo (Nicaragua) and Vulcano (Italy), suggest that SWIR emission from the interiors of high-temperature fumarole vents far exceeds that from their surroundings. In contrast, cooling crust on active lava bodies can contribute more SWIR radiation than the small areas of exposed incandescent material that are often present. Such a distinction should be discernible in the relative response of the two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) SWIR bands, providing a basis for identification of the volcanic nature of thermal anomalies in Landsat TM or similar data, even in the absence of field observations. However, estimates of subpixel temperatures and heat flux, made from such satellite data, must be considered unreliable.},

abstract = {The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Alaska Energy Author- ity are jointly funding a project to re-assess the resource potential of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. Phase one of this project has included airborne thermal infrared remote sensing for mapping surface geothermal phenomena and assess- ment of the resource potential of the system. Thermal infrared and optical images were acquired over the Pilgrim Hot Springs site and neighboring regions during two surveys in fall 2010 and spring 2011. Thermal images providing information on land surface temperature at a spatial resolution better than 1.3 meters were acquired using a FLIR A320 camera operating in the broad 7.5−13 µm wavelength region. Fieldwork during the airborne surveys gathered ground calibration and validation data such as hot spring, ground, and at- mospheric temperatures, atmospheric humidity and the precise GPS locations of low-emissivity ground targets. We applied atmospheric correction, registration and mosaicking to generate seamless maps of calibrated surface temperature across the study area. Analysis of this data enables delineation of the main geothermal features of the system including hot springs, pools, and areas of thermally anomalous ground. Using a thermal-budget approach the thermal heat flux sustaining surface geothermal waters was estimated from the fall and spring FLIR data. Calculated heat fluxes and outflow rates assuming a hot spring temperature of 81°C is significantly higher than previous field-based methods. Our work demonstrates that airborne thermal infrared remote sensing provides a rapid and relatively low cost method for mapping and quantitative assessment of undeveloped spring-dominated geothermal systems in Alaska},

abstract = {We present the first quantitative representation of the intensity of Yellowstone National Park's surficial geothermal activity mapped continuously in space. A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km2 landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0??W m- 2 up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94??W m- 2 (at the 28.5??m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r = 0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone's famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) are currently operational for routine Earth observation. There are substantial differences between instruments onboard both satellites. The enhancements achieved with Landsat-8 refer to the scanning technology (replacing of whisk-broom scanners with two separate push-broom OLI and TIRS scanners), an extended number of spectral bands (two additional bands provided) and narrower bandwidths. Therefore, cross-comparative analysis is very necessary for the combined use of multi-decadal Landsat imagery. In this study, 3,311 independent sample points of four major land cover types (primary forest, unplanted cropland, swidden cultivation and water body) were used to compare the spectral bands of ETM+ and OLI. Eight sample plots with different land cover types were manually selected for comparison with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). These indices were calculated with six pairs of ETM+ and OLI cloud-free images, which were acquired over the border area of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand just two days apart, when Landsat-8 achieved operational obit. Comparative results showed that: (1) the average surface reflectance of each band differed slightly, but with a high degree of similarities between both sensors. In comparison with ETM+, the OLI had higher values for the near-infrared band for vegetative land cover types, but lower values for non-vegetative types. The new sensor had lower values for the shortwave infrared (2.11–2.29 µm) band for all land cover types. In addition, it also basically had higher values for the shortwave infrared (1.57–1.65 µm) band for non-water land cover types. (2) The subtle differences of vegetation indices derived from both sensors and their high linear correlation coefficient (R2},

abstract = { Airborne hyperspectral technology' has progressed to global implementation possibilities for geothermal exploration and assessment. This work describes the unique capabilities of hyperspectral imagers as they pertain to the mapping and characterization of geothermal regions including both geological and biological material mapping. Many of the geological processes, phenomena and products (such as alteration) associated with regions of high geothermal gradients can be imaged, measured, geospatially placed and identified accurately and precisely over large, contiguous areas in virtually any region of the globe by aircraft-mounted imaging spectrometers such as HyMap. For example traditional drilling and field surveys provide extensive mineralogical data at depth and over very small areas. Such activities are considered mandatory in any geothermal exploration program. However hyperspectral remote sensing has the capability to accurately map continuous surface mineralogy over very large areas at small spatial scales (eg. siliceous sinter, travertine or alunite distribution). While resource satellites such as Landsat and ASTER do provide global coverage of basic geology at relatively low spatial resolutions (15-30 m) and low spectral resolutions (40-700 nm), directed high spatial and spectral resolution airborne surveys with HyMap (3-5 m spatial and 13-17 nm spectral) afford incomparable material map generation capabilities. These include not only the specific mineral identification maps discussed above, but also mineral chemistry measurements, proxy temperature estimates and associated geobotanical measurements and distribution maps (that include not only types of vegetation but also relative physiological state).},
