@article{Muffler1978Geothermics,
abstract = {A consistent, agreed-upon terminology is prerequisite for geothermal resource assessment. Accordingly, we propose a logical, sequential subdivision of the “geothermal resource base”, accepting its definition as all the thermal energy in the earth's crust under a given area, measured from mean annual temperature. That part of the resource base which is shallow enough to be tapped by production drilling is termed the “accessible resource base”, and it in turn is divided into “useful” and “residual” components. The useful component (i.e. the thermal energy that could reasonably be extracted at costs competitive with other forms of energy at some specified future time) is termed the “geothermal resource”. This in turn is divided into “economic” and “subeconomic” components, based on conditions existing at the time of assessment. In the format of a McKelvey diagram, this logic defines the vertical axis (degree of economic feasibility). The horizontal axis (degree of geologic assurance) contains “identified” and “undiscovered” components. “Reserve” is then designated as the identified economic resource. All categories should be expressed in units of thermal energy, with resource and reserve figures calculated at wellhead, prior to the inevitable large losses inherent in any practical thermal use or in conversion to electricity. Methods for assessing geothermal resources can be grouped into 4 classes: (a) surface thermal flux, (b) volume, (c) planar fracture and (d) magmatic heat budget. The volume method appears to be most useful because (1) it is applicable to virtually any geologic environment, (2) the required parameters can in Sprinciple be measured or estimated, (3) the inevitable errors are in part compensated and (4) the major uncertainties (recoverability and resupply) are amenable to resolution in the foreseeable future. The major weakness in all the methods rests in the estimation of how much of the accessible resource base can be extracted at some time in the future. In a manner similar to mineral and fuel assessment, this recoverability is expressed as a “recovery factor”. For an ideally permeable hot-water system, the recovery factor may be as much as 50\% and seems to be independent of temperature. It must decrease as effective porosity ($\phi$e) decreases, but the relation between the two is little more than a guess. On the other hand, for favorable systems like Larderello that produce steam by a mechanism of intergranular vaporization, the recovery factor is probably around 15–20\%, decreasing to zero at an effective porosity of zero. According to the anlysis of Bodvarsson (1974), it increases with decreasing reservoir temperature, and as pointed out by Nathenson (1975a) is limited at low temperatures by the need to have sufficient reservoir pressure for extraction and use. The extent to which a geothermal reservoir can be resupplied with heat during “industrial” times of 10–100 yr can be evaluated using simple analytical models. The results, combined with gravity and levelling data of Hunt (1977) for Wairakei and Isherwood (1977) for The Geysers, confirm earlier conclusions by Ramey (1970) and Nathenson (1975a) that resupply to reservoirs producing only steam can be neglected, and the conclusion of Nathenson (1975a) that it may be significant for hot-water systems of high natural discharge. Major subjects that demand continuing investigation include: 1.1. Determination of recovery factors as functions of temperature and effective porosity, particularly for hot-water systems.2.2. Evaluation of fluid recharge and heat resupply by repetitive gravity, levelling and underground temperature surveys in producing geothermal fields.3.3. Analysis of the extent to which a recovery factor can be enhanced by stimulation and by use of confined circulation loops.},

@article{Dickson1988Geothermics,
abstract = {The first industrial (3.5 MW) geothermoelectric power-plant installed in the developing countries was that of Path\'{e}, Mexico, in 1964. A further 75 MW geothermoelectric were added in 1973, again in Mexico, at Cerro Prieto. Other countries later followed the Mexican example, with the result that the geothermoelectric capacity installed in the developing nations increased rapidly from 462 MW in 1979 to 1495 MW in 1984. At the moment (1988) the total geothermoelectric capacity in the developing countries is 1949.7 MW, distributed as follows 2Philippines894 MWMexico700 MWIndonesia142 MWEl Salvador95 MWKenya45 MWNicaragua35 MWTurkey20.6 MWChina17.3 MWArgentina0.6 MWZambia0.2 MW For the moment there are very few non-electric applications of geothermal heat in the developing countries. The most interesting examples in Africa are found in the circum-Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Tunisia) and in Asia in China and Turkey. There are no known plants for the direct use of geothermal heat in Latin-America. The progress of geothermal R\&D is very satisfactory in the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia, fairly satisfactory in Kenya, Ethiopia and some Central-American countries such as El Salvador and Nicaragua, but still at very early stages in most of the other countries. Several nations with favourable geological conditions for the development of geothermal resources have just begun, or have still to begin, their reconnaissance work.},

@article{Kohl2003Geothermics,
abstract = {The increased interest in geothermal energy has led to a desire for more sophisticated analyses of available geothermal resources for heat and power production. The evaluation methods have traditionally used 1-D models, but progress in computing power has recently allowed us to achieve joint interpretations, including the large-scale effects of geological, topographical and hydrogeological features. This paper describes the steps taken in a recent integrated assessment and evaluation of the geothermal potential of the most populated areas of Switzerland. The methodology accounts for individual utilization scenarios and is based on temperature data that have been systematically collected over many years. The state-of-the-art compilation involves comprehensive 3-D regional geological and thermal models of 20-40 km extent. Zones of significant convective flow or preferential sites for borehole heat exchanger systems (BHE) can then be identified. In contrast to the results obtained from earlier geothermal resource assessments, the existing geological, hydrogeological and petrophysical data are included in the full 3-D numerical evaluation. The first results, referred to a well-documented subsurface area in Northern Switzerland, are now available. Analysis of temperature data have confirmed the importance of these factors. © 2003 CNR.

@article{Calcagno2014Geothermics,
abstract = {The geothermal potential of a deep sedimentary-rock reservoir, in a Tertiary graben, the Limagne d'Allier basin (Massif Central, France), is assessed. The most interesting geothermal target is identified as a thick basal Tertiary sandstone overlying crystalline Paleozoic basement. The total amount of recoverable energy in this clastic aquifer is estimated at over 500PJ (500×1015 J) in the modelled area. The most promising zones appear along the north-western edges of the basin, where sediment infill is thickest. The methodology used for estimating geothermal potential starts from geological field data. The first step is to obtain a better understanding of the structure and geometry of the target zone, using various data such as field measurements, and borehole and geophysical data. These data are reinterpreted through the construction of a 3D geological model. Inconsistencies are checked and turned into a coherent 3D interpretation. The second step consists in meshing the geological model into an unstructured 3D finite-element mesh where realistic thermal boundary conditions are applied. The temperature field is computed in a third step. The thermal calculation is achieved by assuming a purely conductive behaviour and through comparison with existing borehole profiles. The computed temperatures fit the measurements in the deepest part of the Limagne d'Allier basin, while the potential role of fluid flow is highlighted in its upper part, either within more permeable formations, or around the boreholes. A fourth, final, step maps the geothermal potential (recoverable energy) in the deepest part of the Tertiary graben, where the total amount of geothermal energy available is calculated. The result of this work provides valuable guidelines for geothermal exploration in the area and our methodology can be replicated elsewhere. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},
