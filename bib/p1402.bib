abstract = {We present the first quantitative representation of the intensity of Yellowstone National Park's surficial geothermal activity mapped continuously in space. A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km2 landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0??W m- 2 up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94??W m- 2 (at the 28.5??m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r = 0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone's famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The U.S. currently leads the world in installed geothermal capacity with power plants in eight states, and exploration for new electrical-grade geothermal systems is ongoing. Geothermal systems at depth may be identified at the surface by hot springs and fumaroles or by minerals produced by thermal fluids (hydrothermal alteration and hot spring deposits). Northern Fish Lake Valley, Nevada hosts two previously known geothermal fields. This study expanded prospects and identified new areas for future exploration within the valley. We demonstrated the potential for using remote sensing data to evaluate regions that are not well explored. We used visible, near, and shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5. ??m) remote sensing data to map surficial mineralogy. Data were collected by three airborne imaging spectrometer instruments, AVIRIS, HyMap, and ProSpecTIR, each over different parts of Fish Lake Valley. Minerals were identified using diagnostic spectral features. We verified remote sensing results in the field using a portable spectrometer to confirm agreement between field and remote spectra.The discovery of additional geothermal resources in Fish Lake Valley may provide the necessary added incentive to build costly transmission lines to this remote location. We used remote sensing data to delineate four new targets for future geothermal exploration in northern Fish Lake Valley. Two new areas of sinter and travertine deposits were identified northwest of the playa, likely deposited around fault-controlled hot springs during the Pleistocene when the water table was higher. Previously undocumented Miocene crystalline travertine was identified within the Emigrant Hills. Argillic alteration was mapped within ranges, where thermal fluids were likely discharged from faults to alter rhyolite tuff. Here we explain our data processing techniques which include a novel decorrelation stretch designed for geothermal prospecting, and discuss how remote sensing results guided our interpretation of the region's geothermal systems. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Multispectral satellite data recorded in the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) region have been used to estimate temperatures of hot volcanic features such as fumaroles and lava bodies. This has required the assumption that thermal distributions across the surfaces in question can be adequately represented by a very few (usually two) temperature components. We investigate here the applicability of such simple descriptions to fumarole fields, an important class of thermal phenomena. Our surface temperature surveys, conducted at Momotombo (Nicaragua) and Vulcano (Italy), suggest that SWIR emission from the interiors of high-temperature fumarole vents far exceeds that from their surroundings. In contrast, cooling crust on active lava bodies can contribute more SWIR radiation than the small areas of exposed incandescent material that are often present. Such a distinction should be discernible in the relative response of the two Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) SWIR bands, providing a basis for identification of the volcanic nature of thermal anomalies in Landsat TM or similar data, even in the absence of field observations. However, estimates of subpixel temperatures and heat flux, made from such satellite data, must be considered unreliable.},

abstract = {The Landsat-8 satellite of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in April 2013. Just weeks after it entered active service, its sensors observed activity at Paluweh Volcano, Indonesia. Given that the image acquired was in the daytime, its shortwave infrared observations were contaminated with reflected solar radiation; however, those of the satellite’s Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) show thermal emission from the volcano’s summit and flanks. These emissions detected in sensor’s band 10 (10.60–11.19 µm) have here been quantified in terms of radiant power, to confirm reports of the actual volcanic processes operating at the time of image acquisition, and to form an initial assessment of the TIRS in its volcanic observation capabilities. Data from band 11 have been neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable at the time of writing. At the instant of image acquisition, the thermal emission of the volcano was found to be 345 MW. This value is shown to be on the same order of magnitude as similarly timed NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer thermal observations. Given its unique characteristics, the TIRS shows much potential for providing useful, detailed and accurate volcanic observations in the future.},

abstract = {Mud volcanoes are relatively small spatter cones that erupt water-laden mud and gases, and occur throughout the world. For many mud volcanoes, the eruption of warm mud (10-40°C) can be detected with high-resolution thermal satellite imagery. We demonstrate the utility of Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery for thermal monitoring of active mud volcanism. We constrain the temperature and area of active mud discharge and estimate surface heat flux for two isolated mud volcanoes in the Copper River Basin, Alaska using Band 6 (10.4-12.5 $\mu$m). The heat flux results span a wide range due to uncertainties in the environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition, but can be constrained to be less than 0.24 MW for each of the two mud volcanoes considering previously published field measurements. With this higher-resolution Band 6 on the ETM+ sensor, as well as the high-resolution thermal bands on the ASTER sensor, reliable monitoring of mud volcanism on this scale is possible for the first time. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Land Surface Temperature (LST) is one of the key inputs for Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere transfer modeling in terrestrial ecosystems. In the frame of BIOSPEC (Linking spectral information at different spatial scales with biophysical parameters of Mediterranean vegetation in the context of global change) and FLUXPEC (Monitoring changes in water and carbon fluxes from remote and proximal sensing in Mediterranean “dehesa” ecosystem) projects LST retrieved from Landsat data is required to integrate ground-based observations of energy, water, and carbon fluxes with multi-scale remotely-sensed data and assess water and carbon balance in ecologically fragile heterogeneous ecosystem of Mediterranean wooded grassland (dehesa). Thus, three methods based on the Radiative Transfer Equation were used to extract LST from a series of 2009–2011 Landsat-5 TM images to assess the applicability for temperature input generation to a Landsat-MODIS LST integration. When compared to surface temperatures simulated using MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) with atmospheric profiles inputs (LSTref), values from Single-Channel (SC) algorithm are the closest (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.50 °C); procedure based on the online Radiative Transfer Equation Atmospheric Correction Parameters Calculator (RTE-ACPC) shows RMSD = 0.85 °C; Mono-Window algorithm (MW) presents the highest RMSD (2.34 °C) with systematical LST underestimation (bias = 1.81 °C). Differences between Landsat-retrieved LST and MODIS LST are in the range of 2 to 4 °C and can be explained mainly by differences in observation geometry, emissivity, and time mismatch between Landsat and MODIS overpasses. There is a seasonal bias in Landsat-MODIS LST differences due to greater variations in surface emissivity and thermal contrasts between landcover components.},

We compiled numerous indicators of these resources into a geographic information system along with concurrent investigative results. This effort required acquisition and analysis of spaceborne multispectral and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for early-stage geothermal exploration. We identified minerals such as alunite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite through analysis of hyperspectral data indicating regions of hydrothermally altered rock associated with areas of geothermal potential. Tertiary volcanic and granitic rocks also contain these indicator minerals. Quaternary environments displayed gypsum-bearing evaporite crusts that we postulate were deposited by sulfate-rich thermal waters. Throughout the PLPTL, tufa towers and tufa shoreline deposits are extensively distributed as remnants of paleo-lake Lahontan. Based on measured spectra of calcium carbonate, we mapped tufa towers elucidating the strike direction of associated faults. Additionally, we correlated remotely-derived maps of shoreline tufa deposits with climate-related changes in lake level. Our mapping results helped guide detailed exploration efforts to areas with the most geothermal potential. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from space. However, retrieving LST is still a challenging task since the LST retrieval problem is ill-posed. This paper reviews the current status of selected remote sensing algorithms for estimating LST from thermal infrared (TIR) data. A brief theoretical background of the subject is presented along with a survey of the algorithms employed for obtaining LST from space-based TIR measurements. The discussion focuses on TIR data acquired from polar-orbiting satellites because of their widespread use, global applicability and higher spatial resolution compared to geostationary satellites.

abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an important technique in the exploration of geothermal resources. In this study, a geothermal survey is conducted in Tengchong area of Yunnan province in China using TIR data from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor. Based on radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and emissivity calculation, a simple but efficient single channel algorithm with acceptable precision is applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of study area. The LST anomalous areas with temperature about 4-10 K higher than background area are discovered. Four geothermal areas are identified with the discussion of geothermal mechanism and the further analysis of regional geologic structure. The research reveals that the distribution of geothermal areas is consistent with the fault development in study area. Magmatism contributes abundant thermal source to study area and the faults provide thermal channels for heat transfer from interior earth to land surface and facilitate the present of geothermal anomalies. Finally, we conclude that TIR remote sensing is a cost-effective technique to detect LST anomalies. Combining TIR remote sensing with geological analysis and the understanding of geothermal mechanism is an accurate and efficient approach to geothermal area detection. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) are currently operational for routine Earth observation. There are substantial differences between instruments onboard both satellites. The enhancements achieved with Landsat-8 refer to the scanning technology (replacing of whisk-broom scanners with two separate push-broom OLI and TIRS scanners), an extended number of spectral bands (two additional bands provided) and narrower bandwidths. Therefore, cross-comparative analysis is very necessary for the combined use of multi-decadal Landsat imagery. In this study, 3,311 independent sample points of four major land cover types (primary forest, unplanted cropland, swidden cultivation and water body) were used to compare the spectral bands of ETM+ and OLI. Eight sample plots with different land cover types were manually selected for comparison with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). These indices were calculated with six pairs of ETM+ and OLI cloud-free images, which were acquired over the border area of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand just two days apart, when Landsat-8 achieved operational obit. Comparative results showed that: (1) the average surface reflectance of each band differed slightly, but with a high degree of similarities between both sensors. In comparison with ETM+, the OLI had higher values for the near-infrared band for vegetative land cover types, but lower values for non-vegetative types. The new sensor had lower values for the shortwave infrared (2.11–2.29 µm) band for all land cover types. In addition, it also basically had higher values for the shortwave infrared (1.57–1.65 µm) band for non-water land cover types.

abstract = {The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Alaska Energy Author- ity are jointly funding a project to re-assess the resource potential of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. Phase one of this project has included airborne thermal infrared remote sensing for mapping surface geothermal phenomena and assess- ment of the resource potential of the system. Thermal infrared and optical images were acquired over the Pilgrim Hot Springs site and neighboring regions during two surveys in fall 2010 and spring 2011. Thermal images providing information on land surface temperature at a spatial resolution better than 1.3 meters were acquired using a FLIR A320 camera operating in the broad 7.5−13 µm wavelength region. Fieldwork during the airborne surveys gathered ground calibration and validation data such as hot spring, ground, and at- mospheric temperatures, atmospheric humidity and the precise GPS locations of low-emissivity ground targets. We applied atmospheric correction, registration and mosaicking to generate seamless maps of calibrated surface temperature across the study area. Analysis of this data enables delineation of the main geothermal features of the system including hot springs, pools, and areas of thermally anomalous ground. Using a thermal-budget approach the thermal heat flux sustaining surface geothermal waters was estimated from the fall and spring FLIR data. Calculated heat fluxes and outflow rates assuming a hot spring temperature of 81°C is significantly higher than previous field-based methods. Our work demonstrates that airborne thermal infrared remote sensing provides a rapid and relatively low cost method for mapping and quantitative assessment of undeveloped spring-dominated geothermal systems in Alaska},

Remote sensing is a component of the current geothermal monitoring plan. Landsat satellite data have a substantial historical archive and will continue to be collected into the future, making it the only available thermal imagery for histori- cal analysis and long-term monitoring of geothermal areas in the entirety of YNP. Landsat imagery from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors was used to examine change trajectories for terrestrial emittance among spatial groupings from 1986 to 2007. Trajectories of locations with known change events were also examined. Relationships between the spatial groupings and several change vectors (distance to geologic faults, distance to large water bodies, and distance to earthquake swarms) were explored. The analysis showed the stron- gest relationship between absolute difference in terrestrial emittance and earthquake swarms, with 34\% of the variation explained. Certain known change events were reflected in the change trajectories, while the Landsat imagery was not able to detect other known events. This suggests that Landsat imagery might be a useful tool for monitoring geothermal responses in YNP, but cannot be expected to suffice as the sole monitoring tool.},

In the frame of BIOSPEC (Linking spectral information at different spatial scales with biophysical parameters of Mediterranean vegetation in the context of global change) and FLUXPEC (Monitoring changes in water and carbon fluxes from remote and proximal sensing in Mediterranean “dehesa” ecosystem) projects LST retrieved from Landsat data is required to integrate ground-based observations of energy, water, and carbon fluxes with multi-scale remotely-sensed data and assess water and carbon balance in ecologically fragile heterogeneous ecosystem of Mediterranean wooded grassland (dehesa). Thus, three methods based on the Radiative Transfer Equation were used to extract LST from a series of 2009–2011 Landsat-5 TM images to assess the applicability for temperature input generation to a Landsat-MODIS LST integration. When compared to surface temperatures simulated using MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) with atmospheric profiles inputs (LSTref), values from Single-Channel (SC) algorithm are the closest (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.50 °C); procedure based on the online Radiative Transfer Equation Atmospheric Correction Parameters Calculator (RTE-ACPC) shows RMSD = 0.85 °C; Mono-Window algorithm (MW) presents the highest RMSD (2.34 °C) with systematical LST underestimation (bias = 1.81 °C). Differences between Landsat-retrieved LST and MODIS LST are in the range of 2 to 4 °C and can be explained mainly by differences in observation geometry, emissivity, and time mismatch between Landsat and MODIS overpasses. There is a seasonal bias in Landsat-MODIS LST differences due to greater variations in surface emissivity and thermal contrasts between landcover components.},

abstract = {The Wenchuan (汶川) earthquake triggered cascading disasters of landslides and debris flows that caused severe vegetation damage. Fracture zones can affect geodynamics and spatial pattern of vegetation damage. A segment tracing algorithm method was applied for identifying the regional fracture system through lineament extractions from a shaded digital elevation model with 25 m mesh for southern Wenchuan. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were used to analyze the spatiotemporal vegetation pattern. The relationship between vegetation type identified from satellite images and lineament density was used to characterize the distribution patterns of each vegetation type according to fracture zones. Broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, and farmland persist in areas with moderate lineament density. Deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forest persists in less fractured areas. Shrub and meadow seem to be relatively evenly distributed across all lineament densities. Meadow, farmland, and shrub persist in the fractured areas. Changes of spatial structure and correlation between vegetation patterns before and after the earthquake were examined using semivariogram analysis of normalized difference vegetation indices derived from Landsat enhanced thematic mapper images. The sill values of the semivariograms show that the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation covers increased after the earthquake. Moreover, the anisotropic behaviors of the semivariograms coincide with the vegetation changes due to the strikes of fracture zones.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of burned areas in Rond\^{o}nia State, Brazil during the years 2000 to 2011 and evaluate the burned area maps. A Linear Spectral Mixture Model (\{LSMM\}) was applied to \{MODIS\} surface reflectance images to originate the burned areas maps, which were validated with \{TM\}/Landsat 5 and \{ETM\}+/Landsat 7 images and field data acquired in August 2013. The validation presented a correlation ranging from 67\% to 96\% with an average value of 86\%. The lower correlation values are related to the distinct spatial resolutions of the \{MODIS\} and \{TM\}/\{ETM\}+ sensors because small burn scars are not detected in \{MODIS\} images and higher spatial correlations are related to the presence of large fires, which are better identified in \{MODIS\}, increasing the accuracy of the mapping methodology. In addition, the 12-year burned area maps of Rond\^{o}nia indicate that fires, as a general pattern, occur in areas that have already been converted to some land use, such as vegetal extraction, large animal livestock areas or diversified permanent crops. Furthermore, during the analyzed period, land use conversion associated with climatic events significantly influenced the occurrence of fire in Rond\^{o}nia and amplified its impacts.},

abstract = { Airborne hyperspectral technology' has progressed to global implementation possibilities for geothermal exploration and assessment. This work describes the unique capabilities of hyperspectral imagers as they pertain to the mapping and characterization of geothermal regions including both geological and biological material mapping. Many of the geological processes, phenomena and products (such as alteration) associated with regions of high geothermal gradients can be imaged, measured, geospatially placed and identified accurately and precisely over large, contiguous areas in virtually any region of the globe by aircraft-mounted imaging spectrometers such as HyMap. For example traditional drilling and field surveys provide extensive mineralogical data at depth and over very small areas. Such activities are considered mandatory in any geothermal exploration program. However hyperspectral remote sensing has the capability to accurately map continuous surface mineralogy over very large areas at small spatial scales (eg. siliceous sinter, travertine or alunite distribution). While resource satellites such as Landsat and ASTER do provide global coverage of basic geology at relatively low spatial resolutions (15-30 m) and low spectral resolutions (40-700 nm), directed high spatial and spectral resolution airborne surveys with HyMap (3-5 m spatial and 13-17 nm spectral) afford incomparable material map generation capabilities. These include not only the specific mineral identification maps discussed above, but also mineral chemistry measurements, proxy temperature estimates and associated geobotanical measurements and distribution maps (that include not only types of vegetation but also relative physiological state).},

abstract = {The U.S. currently leads the world in installed geothermal capacity with power plants in eight states, and exploration for new electrical-grade geothermal systems is ongoing. Geothermal systems at depth may be identified at the surface by hot springs and fumaroles or by minerals produced by thermal fluids (hydrothermal alteration and hot spring deposits). Northern Fish Lake Valley, Nevada hosts two previously known geothermal fields. This study expanded prospects and identified new areas for future exploration within the valley. We demonstrated the potential for using remote sensing data to evaluate regions that are not well explored. We used visible, near, and shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5. ??m) remote sensing data to map surficial mineralogy. Data were collected by three airborne imaging spectrometer instruments, AVIRIS, HyMap, and ProSpecTIR, each over different parts of Fish Lake Valley. Minerals were identified using diagnostic spectral features. We verified remote sensing results in the field using a portable spectrometer to confirm agreement between field and remote spectra.The discovery of additional geothermal resources in Fish Lake Valley may provide the necessary added incentive to build costly transmission lines to this remote location. We used remote sensing data to delineate four new targets for future geothermal exploration in northern Fish Lake Valley. Two new areas of sinter and travertine deposits were identified northwest of the playa, likely deposited around fault-controlled hot springs during the Pleistocene when the water table was higher. Previously undocumented Miocene crystalline travertine was identified within the Emigrant Hills. Argillic alteration was mapped within ranges, where thermal fluids were likely discharged from faults to alter rhyolite tuff. Here we explain our data processing techniques which include a novel decorrelation stretch designed for geothermal prospecting, and discuss how remote sensing results guided our interpretation of the region's geothermal systems. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25–30°C per kilometer depth, however in active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150°C per kilometer depth can be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hot water is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles are evidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling and drying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper we review the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from the traditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirect detection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat fluxes, geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to published remote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions, mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from the La Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between various surface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute to exploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached full maturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework. A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and the present contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number of question lines: ‘how reproducible are remote sensing products’, ‘can long term monitoring of geothermal systems be achieved’ and ‘do surface manifestations link to subsurface features’?},

abstract = {Visible near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has long been used for geothermal exploration. Specific focus on the TIR region (8-12. $\mu$m) has resulted in major-rock-forming mineral classes being identified and their areal percentages to be more easily mapped due in part to the linear mixing behavior of TIR emission. To understand the mineral compositional and thermal distribution of active geothermal surfaces systems, hyperspectral TIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) airborne sensor were acquired over the Salton Sea, CA geothermal fields by The Aerospace Corporation on March 26, 2009 and April 6, 2010. SEBASS collects 128 wavelength channels at \~{}. 1. m spatial resolution. Such high resolution data are rarely available for this type of scientific analysis and enabled the identification of rare mineral assemblages associated with the geothermally-active areas. One surface unit with a unique spectrum, believed to be a magnesium sulfate of unknown hydration state, was identified for the first time in the SEBASS data. The abundance and distribution of this mineral varied between 2009 and 2010 likely due to the precipitation conditions. Data obtained by the SEBASS sensor were also regressed to the 32 channel spectral resolution of the Mineral and Gas Identifier (MAGI) airborne sensor in order to test sensitivity limits. At this lower spectral resolution, all surface minerals were still effectively identified and therefore validated data at MAGI resolution are still very effective for accurate surface compositional mapping. A similar approach used at active geothermal areas in other semi-arid regions around the world has the potential to better characterize transient mineralogy, identify "indicators minerals", understand the influence of surface and ground water, and ultimately to locate new geothermal targets for future exploration. Furthermore, new Mineral and Gas Identification (MAGI) data serve as an excellent precursor for future spaceborne TIR data such as the system proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) instrument. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Landsat-8 satellite of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission was launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in April 2013. Just weeks after it entered active service, its sensors observed activity at Paluweh Volcano, Indonesia. Given that the image acquired was in the daytime, its shortwave infrared observations were contaminated with reflected solar radiation; however, those of the satellite’s Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) show thermal emission from the volcano’s summit and flanks. These emissions detected in sensor’s band 10 (10.60–11.19 µm) have here been quantified in terms of radiant power, to confirm reports of the actual volcanic processes operating at the time of image acquisition, and to form an initial assessment of the TIRS in its volcanic observation capabilities. Data from band 11 have been neglected as its data have been shown to be unreliable at the time of writing. At the instant of image acquisition, the thermal emission of the volcano was found to be 345 MW. This value is shown to be on the same order of magnitude as similarly timed NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer thermal observations. Given its unique characteristics, the TIRS shows much potential for providing useful, detailed and accurate volcanic observations in the future.},

The temperature model was realized with universal kriging, and extends from ground level to 5000. m below sea level. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) mapping algorithms are often used to estimate subsurface temperature at certain depths. The major limitation of any 2D mapping is the possibility of inconsistencies between different depths due to the loss of information from shallower levels. A different approach is used in this paper. The application of 3D-kriging in the context of subsurface temperature estimation is described in detail and variation of data density and quality are also discussed. Kriging employs customized prediction parameters for an unbiased estimate of the subsurface temperature distribution. The kriging variance predicts the uncertainty of the temperature estimate and provides a local probability interval of the temperature estimate.

Rocks can be characterized mainly in terms of their lithology, mineralogy, fracture distribution, permeability, thermal conductivity and porosity, and similarly the geothermal fluid (and its circulation) by its geochemistry, flow pattern, velocity, temperature and pressure. Some of these data are obtained by well logging and from laboratory tests conducted on drillhole cores. In general, the distribution of geothermal wells is not random, and well data are limited in terms of quantity and depth range. Accordingly, a sophisticated spatial modeling technique is indispensable in the three-dimensional imaging of geothermal systems. We describe a versatile 3-D modeling method that can be used to determine the temperature, flow velocity, and distribution of geological units within a geothermal field based on well log data. The model results for the Hohi geothermal area, Japan, provide plausible estimates of temperature, flow velocity, and geology to a depth of 3000 m. Superimposition of the three spatial models we obtained shows that, at Hohi, two geothermal reservoirs are localized near highly fractured fault zones that provide paths for the ascent of thermal fluids from depth. ?? 2007 CNR.},

abstract = {We analyse shortwave infrared thermal data of the phase 1 eruption of Unzen Volcano (Japan) extracted from eight nighttime Thematic Mapper (TM) images taken from the Landsat 5 satellite between October 1991 and November 1992. We identify two discrete regions of the dome that were heated to high temperature by the ongoing eruptive activity; a fumarolically heated region and an area associated with the effusion of new lava. We concentrate analysis on the fumarolically heated region and investigate the relationships between parameters derived from the infrared radiance data and the nature of the fumarolic gas and magma fluxes. Temporal variations in the parameters derived from the radiance data closely follow those observed in the measured rate of magma effusion. The positive correlation observed between the fumarolically driven shortwave infrared flux and the magma discharge rate (r2 = 0.64) indicates that degassing occurred efficiently and in proportion to the amount of magma supplied. Over our monitoring period, the data suggest that gas accumulation within the edifice did not occur, this conclusion agreeing with a previous finding obtained using correlation spectrometer (COSPEC) analysis of SO2 flux rates. A positive correlation (r2 = 0.56) was also found between the mean radiance of the pixels in the fumarolically heated region and the overall size of that region. This suggests a potential mechanism whereby, when gas pressure within the edifice increased, excess gas escaped through additional pathways to the surface as well through an increased flux at the main fumarolic vents.},

There are substantial differences between instruments onboard both satellites. The enhancements achieved with Landsat-8 refer to the scanning technology (replacing of whisk-broom scanners with two separate push-broom OLI and TIRS scanners), an extended number of spectral bands (two additional bands provided) and narrower bandwidths. Therefore, cross-comparative analysis is very necessary for the combined use of multi-decadal Landsat imagery. In this study, 3,311 independent sample points of four major land cover types (primary forest, unplanted cropland, swidden cultivation and water body) were used to compare the spectral bands of ETM+ and OLI. Eight sample plots with different land cover types were manually selected for comparison with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). These indices were calculated with six pairs of ETM+ and OLI cloud-free images, which were acquired over the border area of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand just two days apart, when Landsat-8 achieved operational obit. Comparative results showed that: (1) the average surface reflectance of each band differed slightly, but with a high degree of similarities between both sensors. In comparison with ETM+, the OLI had higher values for the near-infrared band for vegetative land cover types, but lower values for non-vegetative types. The new sensor had lower values for the shortwave infrared (2.11–2.29 µm) band for all land cover types. In addition, it also basically had higher values for the shortwave infrared (1.57–1.65 µm) band for non-water land cover types.

In this study, a geothermal survey is conducted in Tengchong area of Yunnan province in China using TIR data from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor. Based on radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and emissivity calculation, a simple but efficient single channel algorithm with acceptable precision is applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of study area. The LST anomalous areas with temperature about 4-10 K higher than background area are discovered. Four geothermal areas are identified with the discussion of geothermal mechanism and the further analysis of regional geologic structure. The research reveals that the distribution of geothermal areas is consistent with the fault development in study area. Magmatism contributes abundant thermal source to study area and the faults provide thermal channels for heat transfer from interior earth to land surface and facilitate the present of geothermal anomalies. Finally, we conclude that TIR remote sensing is a cost-effective technique to detect LST anomalies.

abstract = {Thermal activity monitoring in and around active volcanic areas using remote sensing is an essential part of volcanology nowadays. Three identical approaches were used for thermal activity exploration at Aso volcanic area in Japan using Landsat ETM+images. First, the conventional methods for hydrothermal alteration mapping were applied to find the most active thermal region after exploring geothermal indicator minerals. Second, we found some thermally highly anomalous regions around Nakadake crater using land surface temperature estimation. Then, the Stefan-Boltzmann equation was used for estimating and also monitoring radiative heat flux (RHF) from the most active region of about 8km2 in and around Nakadake crater in the central part of the Aso volcano. To fulfill the required parameter in the Stefan-Boltzmann equation for radiative heat flux, the NDVI (Normalized differential vegetation index) method was used for spectral emissivity, and the mono-window algorithm was used for land surface temperature of this study area. The NDVI value was used to divide land-cover in the study area into four types: water, bare ground, mixed and vegetated land. The bare land was found within the most active region. Vegetation coverage area showed an inverse relationship with total RHF in this study as health of thermally stressed vegetation supports this relationship. The spatial distribution of spectral emissivity ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 in our study. Land surface temperature was estimated using a mono-window algorithm and was highest LST in 2008 and lowest in 2011. The results of RHF showed that the highest pixel RHF was found to be about 296W/m2 in 2008. Total RHF was obtained of about 607MW in 2002 and the lowest was about 354MW in 2008. The RHF anomaly area was found the highest in 2002 and was lowest in 2011. The highest total heat discharge rate (HDR) obtained about 3918MW in 2002 and lowest total HDR about 2289MW in 2008 from this study area. But in the case of Nakadake crater alone, the higher thermal activity was observed in 2008 and was less in 2004. The study showed that Landsat thermal infrared is the best option for thermal activity exploration and monitoring at Aso volcano as well as in any active volcano region considering high efficiency and low cost.},

abstract = {Air surface temperature (T air) is an important parameter for a wide range of applications such as vector-borne disease bionomics, hydrology and climate change studies. Air temperature data is usually obtained from measurements made in meteorological stations, providing only limited information about spatial patterns over wide areas. The use of remote sensing data can help overcome this problem, particularly in areas with low station density, having the potential to improve the estimation of T air at both regional and global scales. Some studies have tried to derive maximum (T max), minimum (T min) and average air temperature (T avg) using different methods, with variable estimation accuracy; errors generally fall in the 2-3??C range while the level of precision generally considered as accurate is 1-2??C. The main objective of this study was to accurately estimate T max, T min and T avg for a 10year period based on remote sensing-Land Surface Temperature (LST) data obtained from MODIS-and auxiliary data using a statistical approach. An optimization procedure with a mixed bootstrap and jackknife resampling was employed. The statistical models estimated Tavg with a MEF (Model Efficiency Index) of 0.941 and a RMSE of 1.33??C. Regarding T max and T min, the best MEF achieved was 0.919 and 0.871, respectively, with a 1.83 and 1.74??C RMSE. The developed datasets provided weekly 1km estimations and accurately described both the intra and inter annual temporal and spatial patterns of T air. Potential sources of uncertainty and error were also analyzed and identified. The most promising developments were proposed with the aim of developing accurate T air estimations at a larger scale in the future. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Asaue2006,
abstract = {Geothermal reservoirs are usually located at a depth range of 2 to 5 km, so to efficiently utilize such resources an advanced prospecting method is needed to detect these deep geologic structures. This study aimed to three-dimensionally characterize geothermal reservoirs by a combination of Magnetotelluric (MT) survey, inversion analysis of apparent resistivity, and interpolation of the resistivity data obtained. The western side of Mt. Aso crater, southwest Japan, was chosen as the case study area. Three hot springs exist there and a fault is assumed to go in the direction connecting them. A MT survey was carried out at 26 sites and the data processed by a remote reference method to reduce artificial noises. Based on skewness and Mohr circle analyses of the impedance tensor, the local geologic structure at each site could be approximated as horizontally layered and therefore, a one-dimensional inversion analysis was applied to the MT raw data. The resultant resistivity column data were then interpolated by the three-dimensional optimization principle method. The resistivity distributions obtained clarified continuous conductors with especially low resistivity (less than 10 $\Omega$·m) at the hot springs along the fault. Because the resistivity decreases largely with an abundance of clay minerals, the conductors could be considered to correspond with the cap rocks. Thus, two geothermal reservoirs, whose shapes were estimated to be pillar, were detected under the cap rocks in an elevation range of - 1000 to - 3000 m. By comparing the resistivity distributions with the temperature distributions based on fluid-flow calculations at a steady state using FEM, the validity of the location and dimension of the estimated reservoirs were confirmed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of burned areas in Rond\^{o}nia State, Brazil during the years 2000 to 2011 and evaluate the burned area maps. A Linear Spectral Mixture Model (LSMM) was applied to MODIS surface reflectance images to originate the burned areas maps, which were validated with TM/Landsat 5 and ETM+/Landsat 7 images and field data acquired in August 2013. The validation presented a correlation ranging from 67\% to 96\% with an average value of 86\%. The lower correlation values are related to the distinct spatial resolutions of the MODIS and TM/ETM+ sensors because small burn scars are not detected in MODIS images and higher spatial correlations are related to the presence of large fires, which are better identified in MODIS, increasing the accuracy of the mapping methodology. In addition, the 12-year burned area maps of Rond\^{o}nia indicate that fires, as a general pattern, occur in areas that have already been converted to some land use, such as vegetal extraction, large animal livestock areas or diversified permanent crops. Furthermore, during the analyzed period, land use conversion associated with climatic events significantly influenced the occurrence of fire in Rond\^{o}nia and amplified its impacts},

abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25–30°C per kilometer depth, however in active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150°C per kilometer depth can be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hot water is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles are evidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling and drying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper we review the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from the traditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirect detection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat fluxes, geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to published remote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions, mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from the La Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between various surface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute to exploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached full maturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework. A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and the present contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number of question lines: ‘how reproducible are remote sensing products’, ‘can long term monitoring of geothermal systems be achieved’ and ‘do surface manifestations link to subsurface features’?},

abstract = {The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Alaska Energy Author- ity are jointly funding a project to re-assess the resource potential of the Pilgrim Hot Springs geothermal system in western Alaska. Phase one of this project has included airborne thermal infrared remote sensing for mapping surface geothermal phenomena and assess- ment of the resource potential of the system. Thermal infrared and optical images were acquired over the Pilgrim Hot Springs site and neighboring regions during two surveys in fall 2010 and spring 2011. Thermal images providing information on land surface temperature at a spatial resolution better than 1.3 meters were acquired using a FLIR A320 camera operating in the broad 7.5−13 µm wavelength region. Fieldwork during the airborne surveys gathered ground calibration and validation data such as hot spring, ground, and at- mospheric temperatures, atmospheric humidity and the precise GPS locations of low-emissivity ground targets. We applied atmospheric correction, registration and mosaicking to generate seamless maps of calibrated surface temperature across the study area. Analysis of this data enables delineation of the main geothermal features of the system including hot springs, pools, and areas of thermally anomalous ground. Using a thermal-budget approach the thermal heat flux sustaining surface geothermal waters was estimated from the fall and spring FLIR data. Calculated heat fluxes and outflow rates assuming a hot spring temperature of 81°C is significantly higher than previous field-based methods. Our work demonstrates that airborne thermal infrared remote sensing provides a rapid and relatively low cost method for mapping and quantitative assessment of undeveloped spring-dominated geothermal systems in Alaska},

Specific focus on the TIR region (8-12. $\mu$m) has resulted in major-rock-forming mineral classes being identified and their areal percentages to be more easily mapped due in part to the linear mixing behavior of TIR emission. To understand the mineral compositional and thermal distribution of active geothermal surfaces systems, hyperspectral TIR data from the Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) airborne sensor were acquired over the Salton Sea, CA geothermal fields by The Aerospace Corporation on March 26, 2009 and April 6, 2010. SEBASS collects 128 wavelength channels at \~{}. 1. m spatial resolution. Such high resolution data are rarely available for this type of scientific analysis and enabled the identification of rare mineral assemblages associated with the geothermally-active areas. One surface unit with a unique spectrum, believed to be a magnesium sulfate of unknown hydration state, was identified for the first time in the SEBASS data. The abundance and distribution of this mineral varied between 2009 and 2010 likely due to the precipitation conditions. Data obtained by the SEBASS sensor were also regressed to the 32 channel spectral resolution of the Mineral and Gas Identifier (MAGI) airborne sensor in order to test sensitivity limits. At this lower spectral resolution, all surface minerals were still effectively identified and therefore validated data at MAGI resolution are still very effective for accurate surface compositional mapping. A similar approach used at active geothermal areas in other semi-arid regions around the world has the potential to better characterize transient mineralogy, identify "indicators minerals", understand the influence of surface and ground water, and ultimately to locate new geothermal targets for future exploration. Furthermore, new Mineral and Gas Identification (MAGI) data serve as an excellent precursor for future spaceborne TIR data such as the system proposed for the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) instrument. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents a plan for increasing the mapped resource base for geothermal exploration in the Western US. We plan to image large areas in the western US with recently developed high resolution hyperspectral geobotanical remote sensing tools. The proposed imaging systems have the ability to map visible faults, surface effluents, historical signatures, and discover subtle hidden faults and hidden thermal systems. Large regions can be imaged at reasonable costs. The technique of geobotanical remote sensing for geothermal signatures is based on recent successes in mapping faults and effluents the Long Valley Caldera and Mammoth Mountain in California.},
