abstract = {Australia has considerable hot rock geothermal energy potential. This results from the widespread occurrence of basement rocks (granites in particular) in which heat is generated by natural radioactive decay. There are extensive areas where temperatures are estimated to reach at least 200 °C at around 5 km depth. In Australia, there is also potential for lower temperature geothermal resources associated with naturally-circulating waters in aquifers deep in a number of sedimentary basins (Hot Sedimentary Aquifer Geothermal). These are potentially suitable for electricity generation and direct use. This paper will focus on the need to improve geothermal energy utilization in Australia, challenges facing it and the future benefits. This study shows, there is a significant potential for energy savings through greater use of geothermal energy in some regions of Australia. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Geothermal resources have the potential of contri- buting significantly to sustainable development in many parts of the world. Sustainable management of a geothermal resource involves utilization at a rate, which may be maintained for a very long time (100- 300 years). The energy production potential of geo- thermal systems is primarily determined by the pressure decline caused by production. Overexploit- ation of geothermal systems mostly occurs because of poor understanding, due to inadequate monitoring, and when many users utilize the same resource without common management. Careful monitoring and modeling, as well as energy-efficient utilization, are essential ingredients in sustainable management. Reinjection is also essential for sustainable utilization of geothermal systems, which are virtually closed and with limited recharge. The Hamar low-temperature geothermal system in the volcanic lava-pile of Central N-Iceland and the low-temperature geothermal resources in the sedimentary basin below the city of Beijing, P.R. of China have been utilized for decades. They are examples of geothermal resources, of highly contrasting nature, which may each be managed in a sustainable manner. The sustainable potential of the Hamar system is estimated, through modeling, to be greater than 40 kg/s of 65°C water. Reinjection is essential for sus- tainable management of the Beijing resource. The Nesjavellir high-temperature geothermal field is located inside the volcanic zone in SW-Iceland. Production from the field is planned at 120 MWe, and 300 MWt, for the next decades. This production can’t be maintained in a sustainable manner for 100- 300 years, but the impact appears to be reversible and the field may likely be utilized at a reduced rate, in a sustainable manner following a 30-year period of excessive utilization.},

abstract = {The Wenchuan (汶川) earthquake triggered cascading disasters of landslides and debris flows that caused severe vegetation damage. Fracture zones can affect geodynamics and spatial pattern of vegetation damage. A segment tracing algorithm method was applied for identifying the regional fracture system through lineament extractions from a shaded digital elevation model with 25 m mesh for southern Wenchuan. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were used to analyze the spatiotemporal vegetation pattern. The relationship between vegetation type identified from satellite images and lineament density was used to characterize the distribution patterns of each vegetation type according to fracture zones. Broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, and farmland persist in areas with moderate lineament density. Deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forest persists in less fractured areas. Shrub and meadow seem to be relatively evenly distributed across all lineament densities. Meadow, farmland, and shrub persist in the fractured areas. Changes of spatial structure and correlation between vegetation patterns before and after the earthquake were examined using semivariogram analysis of normalized difference vegetation indices derived from Landsat enhanced thematic mapper images. The sill values of the semivariograms show that the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation covers increased after the earthquake. Moreover, the anisotropic behaviors of the semivariograms coincide with the vegetation changes due to the strikes of fracture zones.},

@article{Meer2014IJAEOG,
abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25–30°C per kilometer depth, however in active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150°C per kilometer depth can be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hot water is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles are evidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling and drying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper we review the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from the traditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirect detection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat fluxes, geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to published remote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions, mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from the La Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between various surface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute to exploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached full maturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework. A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and the present contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number of question lines: ‘how reproducible are remote sensing products’, ‘can long term monitoring of geothermal systems be achieved’ and ‘do surface manifestations link to subsurface features’?},

@article{Haehnlein2010,
abstract = {Shallow geothermal energy (<400 m depth) is used in many countries worldwide, with a rising number of installations over the last decades. The use of ground source heat pump (GSHP) and groundwater heat pump (GWHP) systems results in local temperature anomalies (cold or heat plumes). Since groundwater is used in many countries as source for drinking water a balance between its use and protection has to be found. Therefore, to avoid detrimental environmental impacts it is necessary to define groundwater temperature limits for heating and cooling and minimum distances between such geothermal systems. The aim of the present study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current international legal status for the use of shallow geothermal energy. Therefore, an international survey was performed using a questionnaire, which was sent to more than 60 countries worldwide. The questionnaire requested information on the corresponding national legislation, temperature limits and minimum distances for GSHP and GWHP systems. The answers to the inquiry showed an extremely heterogeneous outcome. Until now national and legally binding regulations only exist in few countries such as Denmark or Sweden. However, all existing regulations show a wide range for minimum distances (5-300 m) and temperature limits for groundwater. The highest inconsistency was observed for the acceptable temperature change with 3 K in Switzerland to 11 K in France. However, most countries have no legally binding regulations or even guidelines, which highlight the urgent need for further research on the environmental impact and legal management of shallow geothermal installations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The first of them lies on the estimation of the land surface temperature from the radiative transfer equation using in situ radiosounding data. The others two are the mono-window algorithm developed by Qin et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 22 (2001) 3719] and the single-channel algorithm developed by Jim\'{e}nez- Mu\~{n}oz and Sobrino [Journal of Geophysical Research 108 (2003)]. The land surface emissivity (LSE) values needed in order to apply these methods have been estimated from a methodology that uses the visible and near infrared bands. Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jim\'{e}nez-Mu\~{n}oz algorithm is used. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Taiwan government has also recognized the increasing need for energy independence, and has passed relevant acts and regulations to promote renewable energy. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of renewable energy development in Taiwan. Current conditions and future prospects of six types of renewable energy in Taiwan are discussed: wind energy, ocean energy, solar energy, biomass energy, geothermal energy and hydropower energy. The findings show that solar thermal energy, photovoltaics and wind energy are the most promising renewable energy sources in Taiwan because of Taiwan׳s geographical characteristics and technological advantages acquired in the related industries.},

abstract = {After many years of stagnant growth in geothermal power generation, development plans for new geothermal plants have recently emerged throughout Japan. Through a literature review, we investigated the relationships between the principal barriers to geothermal development and we thereby analyzed the deciding factors in the future success of such enterprises. The results show that the societal acceptance of geothermal power by local stakeholders is the fundamental barrier as it affects almost all other barriers, such as financial, technical, and political risks. Thus, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 stakeholders including developers, hot spring inn managers, and local government officials. Some hot spring inn managers and local government officials noted that they have always been strongly concerned about the adverse effects of geothermal power generation on hot springs; their opposition has delayed decision-making by local governments regarding drilling permits, prolonged lead times, and caused other difficulties. A key reason for opposition was identified as uncertainty about the reversibility and predictability of the adverse effects on hot springs and other underground structures by geothermal power production and reinjection of hot water from reservoirs. Therefore, we discuss and recommend options for improving the risk management of hot springs near geothermal power plants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy source, one of the viable renewable energy sources, has encouraging potential to generate full base-load electricity, which has not been explored so far in Pakistan. Though the country can be benefited by harnessing the hydro-geothermal options of energy generation in areas where sources exist, but most of these sources lie in extreme remote and inaccessible rugged mountainous ranges away from the urban-industrial centers. On the other hand, the present study shows that the HDR geothermal option is one of the most viable renewable sources considering the tectonic setup of Pakistan. Results of the study highlight the HDR geothermal energy prospects at relatively deeper depths than hydro-geothermal resources in water-free condition. The basement tectonic analyses reveal that the HDR prospects could be found even just below the urban-industrial centers of Pakistan where there are no hot springs and/or geysers like southern Indus basin in Sindh province or the Kharan trough in the western Balochistan province. Presence of high earth-skin temperature gradient trends derived from satellite temperature data and the high geothermal gradient anomalous zone derived from scanty data of bottom-hole temperatures of some of the oil and gas exploratory wells, indicates encouraging prospects for HDR energy sources in southern Indus and Thar Desert regions inclusive of Karachi synclinorium area. These high geothermal gradients have been inferred to be the result of the deep-seated southern Indus and the Thar fossil-rift structures. Moreover, the prospects of the HDR geothermal energy sources have also been inferred in the Chagai Arc region and the Kharan-Panjgur tectonic depression in the western part of Pakistan based on the analysis of integrated geophysical data. If HDR prospects are developed, they can offer the sustainable, CO2-free and independent of time, of day, of weather or season, and the base-load energy-generation resource. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in hydrothermal systems in China with emphasis on current studies of potential and reservoir engineering. Three hydrothermal systems, namely, Yangbajing, Xianyang, and Xiongxian, are used as case studies to represent high temperature granite reservoirs, medium-to-low temperature sandstone reservoirs, and medium-to-low temperature carbonate reservoirs, respectively. There is a huge potential of hydrothermal resources in China that have not been fully studied for possible exploitation. The study reveals that the potential of developing hydrothermal resources is preferable to exploitation of hot-dry-rock (HDR) systems in the near future. In order to enhance the utilization efficiency and prolong the economic lifetime of a geothermal field, reinjection needs to be increased, including treated wastewater as an option. In this regard, deep karstic aquifers containing hot water are the most ideal targets for development due to their favorable characteristics including high single-well yield, low salinity, easy reinjection, and fewer environmental impacts when exploited. The next challenge lies in the geothermal reservoir management for sustainable production. Numerical models describing the full complexity of coupled physicochemical thermodynamic processes such as the open source OpenGeoSys modeling platform are powerful tools for production planning as well as for assessing the possible environmental impacts. Comprehensive reservoir simulation should be employed to provide an optimal fluid production scheme and to maximize the sustainability in the development of a hydrothermal field.},

abstract = {The geothermal potential of a deep sedimentary-rock reservoir, in a Tertiary graben, the Limagne d'Allier basin (Massif Central, France), is assessed. The most interesting geothermal target is identified as a thick basal Tertiary sandstone overlying crystalline Paleozoic basement. The total amount of recoverable energy in this clastic aquifer is estimated at over 500PJ (500×1015 J) in the modelled area. The most promising zones appear along the north-western edges of the basin, where sediment infill is thickest. The methodology used for estimating geothermal potential starts from geological field data. The first step is to obtain a better understanding of the structure and geometry of the target zone, using various data such as field measurements, and borehole and geophysical data. These data are reinterpreted through the construction of a 3D geological model. Inconsistencies are checked and turned into a coherent 3D interpretation. The second step consists in meshing the geological model into an unstructured 3D finite-element mesh where realistic thermal boundary conditions are applied. The temperature field is computed in a third step. The thermal calculation is achieved by assuming a purely conductive behaviour and through comparison with existing borehole profiles. The computed temperatures fit the measurements in the deepest part of the Limagne d'Allier basin, while the potential role of fluid flow is highlighted in its upper part, either within more permeable formations, or around the boreholes. A fourth, final, step maps the geothermal potential (recoverable energy) in the deepest part of the Tertiary graben, where the total amount of geothermal energy available is calculated. The result of this work provides valuable guidelines for geothermal exploration in the area and our methodology can be replicated elsewhere. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth's interior. The paper describes the internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside the mantle and crust. It also shows the location of geothermal fields on specific areas of the Earth. The Earth's heat flow and geothermal gradient are defined, as well as the types of geothermal fields, the geologic environment of geothermal energy, and the methods for geothermal exploration Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades to generate electricity, both in space heating and industrial processes. The geothermal electrical installed capacity in the world is 7173.5 MWe (December 1996), and the electrical energy generated is 38 billion kW h/year, representing 0.4\% of the world total electrical energy which was 13,267 billion kWh in 1995. The thermal capacity in non-electrical uses (greenhouses, aquaculture, district heating, industrial processes) is 8664 MW1 (end of 1994). Electricity is produced with an efficiency of 10–17\%, and the geothermal kWh is generally cost-competitive with conventional sources of energy, in the range 3–12 US cents/kWh. The geothermal electrical capacity installed in the world is probably comparable with that from biomass. but almost twice that from solar or wind sources summed together. In developing countries, where total installed electrical power is still low, geothermal energy can play a significant role: in El Salvador 15\% of electricity comes from geothermal steam, 15\% in Nicaragua. 21\% in the Philippines, and 6\% in Kenya and Costa Rica. Financial investments in geothermal electrical and non-electrical uses worldwide are summarised. Present technology makes it possible to control the environmental impact of geothermal exploitation. The future use of the geothermal energy from advanced technologies such as the exploitation of geopressured reservoirs, hot dry rock systems and magma bodies is briefly discussed. While the viability of hot dry rock technology has been proved., research and development are still necessary for the other two sources. Finally, a brief discussion follows on training of specialists, geothermal literature, on-line information, and geothermal associations. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd},

This study refers to the use of natural gas in school units in Greece. More specifically, it focuses on school units that are connected to the natural gas network and on the economic and environmental benefits arising from this. In this context, the advantages and disadvantages in using natural gas are compared with those resulting from the use of geothermal energy. In areas which have a significant geothermal potential, the choice of geothermal heating and cooling of large school units is the best solution, but this however does not apply to all areas. Clearly, the development of geothermal energy in school units is still in pilot stage. However, the use of natural gas in school units has been rising over the last decade and it has already contributed to some extent towards the reduction of carbon dioxide and towards saving natural resources. Thus, the survey shows clear advantages in using natural gas and in plans to extend its use to other school units. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For a country that was already uneasy about energy security, the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which caused a nuclear catastrophe in TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, turned this unease into outright anxiety. With the temporary and/or permanent closure of many nuclear reactors Japan has had to replace lost power. Tokyo has had no choice but to secure additional fossil fuels, a strategy that has negatively affected Japan's economy due to rising fuel costs. The increase in Japan's fossil fuel consumption has also caused a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, and affected Tokyo's commitment to Kyoto targets. This paper analyzes the consequences of the 2011 nuclear disaster for Japan's energy security. Recognizing that Japan's future energy policy choices are constrained and path dependent, the paper outlines energy policy recommendations for Japan's government. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The temperature model was realized with universal kriging, and extends from ground level to 5000. m below sea level. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) mapping algorithms are often used to estimate subsurface temperature at certain depths. The major limitation of any 2D mapping is the possibility of inconsistencies between different depths due to the loss of information from shallower levels. A different approach is used in this paper. The application of 3D-kriging in the context of subsurface temperature estimation is described in detail and variation of data density and quality are also discussed. Kriging employs customized prediction parameters for an unbiased estimate of the subsurface temperature distribution. The kriging variance predicts the uncertainty of the temperature estimate and provides a local probability interval of the temperature estimate.

The primary objective was to establish the feasibility of performing initial reconnaissance of an unmapped area with airborne or spacecraft remote sensors. The field experiments were conducted against a series of known geothermal regions in California. These regions were chosen to represent a typical range of geologic and environmental settings. It was attempted to relate remotely sensed and in-situ geophysical measurements of representative geothermal regions through a diurnal and seasonal range of variation. Effects of varying flight altitude on thermal anomaly « signatures \aa are also presented. Multiband photography in the visible and near infra-red was used to delineate anomalous spectral reflectance associated with hydrothermal alteration zones, passive \{\{IR\}\} imagery and radiometry in the 8 to 14 $\mu$ band, as well as passive microwave radiometry at 16 and 19 \{\{GHz\}\} was used to detect combined temperature and emissivity anomalies. Preliminary laboratory studies of field samples served to define the sensor passbands to be employed and permit later interpretation of observed effects. Ground controls on the experiment included detailed thermometric, gravity, magnetic and subsurface heat flow mapping. The major results of this investigation may be summarized as the identification of temperature anomalies in not only the infrared; but also the microwave, Rayleigh-Jeans region of the spectrum. Subsidiary conclusions were the uniform presence of visible alteration haloes, soil moisture anomalies, and apparent structural control of the thermal zones. While these techniques were applied in the nature of a controlled experiment, the results are considered generally applicable to related problems of geologic reconnaissance.},

abstract = {The Landsat program has been producing an archive of thermal imagery that spans the globe and covers 30 years of the thermal history of the planet at human scales 
(60–120 m). Most of that archive’s absolute radiometric calibration has been fixed through vicarious calibration techniques. These calibration ties to trusted values have often taken a year or more to gather sufficient data and, in some cases, it has been over a decade before calibration certainty has been established. With temperature being such a critical factor for all living systems and the ongoing concern over the impacts of climate change, NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are leading efforts to provide timely and accurate temperature data from the Landsat thermal data archive. This paper discusses two closely related advances that are critical steps toward providing timely and reliable temperature image maps from Landsat. The first advance involves the development and testing of an autonomous procedure for gathering and performing initial screening of large amounts of vicarious calibration data. The second advance discussed in this paper is the 
per-pixel atmospheric compensation of the data to permit calculation of the emitted surface radiance (using ancillary sources of emissivity data) and the corresponding land surface temperature (LST).},

abstract = {Turkey is one of the countries with significant potential in geothermal energy. It is estimated that if Turkey utilizes all of her geothermal potential, she can meet 14\% of her total energy need (heat and electricity) from geothermal sources. Therefore, today geothermal energy is an attractive option in Turkey to replace fossil fuels. Besides, increase in negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment has forced many countries, including Turkey, to use renewable energy sources. Also, Turkey is an energy importing country; more than two-thirds of her energy requirement is supplied by imports. In this context, geothermal energy appears to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development and environmental pollution prevention in Turkey. Since geothermal energy will be used more and more in the future, its current potential, usage, and assessment in Turkey is the focus of the present study. The paper not only presents a review of the potential and utilization of the geothermal energy in Turkey but also provides some guidelines for policy makers. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an important technique in the exploration of geothermal resources. In this study, a geothermal survey is conducted in Tengchong area of Yunnan province in China using TIR data from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor. Based on radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and emissivity calculation, a simple but efficient single channel algorithm with acceptable precision is applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of study area. The LST anomalous areas with temperature about 4-10 K higher than background area are discovered. Four geothermal areas are identified with the discussion of geothermal mechanism and the further analysis of regional geologic structure. The research reveals that the distribution of geothermal areas is consistent with the fault development in study area. Magmatism contributes abundant thermal source to study area and the faults provide thermal channels for heat transfer from interior earth to land surface and facilitate the present of geothermal anomalies. Finally, we conclude that TIR remote sensing is a cost-effective technique to detect LST anomalies. Combining TIR remote sensing with geological analysis and the understanding of geothermal mechanism is an accurate and efficient approach to geothermal area detection. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Serbia, as a European country in its early stage of development, is trying to synchronize its progress with experience of other countries from the field of sustainable development and in accordance with rules in the field of energetic and energetic efficiency, and, as well as to promote and develop the sector of use of renewable sources of energy. On the other hand, Serbia is a country which largely depends on import of all forms of energy, which to a great extent affects its economic stability. Therefore, in Serbia the strategy for development of energetic was imposed and it considers all the aspects of development of energetic until 2015 and it also defines the priorities which can be mostly seen in the choice of forms of alternative sources of energy. These sources, based on some criteria, can be considered the most convenient for a gradual substitution of energy which is gotten from the conventional sources. Taking into account strategically defined goals and domestic potentials which are at disposal, as well as economic parameters, an alternative source of energy of basic importance for the future exploitation on the territory of Serbia geothermal energy, was chosen. The research points to the fact that Serbia will be capable to respond adequately to Kyoto protocol demands and to the European rules regarding the substitution of a certain amounts of fossil fuels by the fuel origin from the raw biological materials. The research defines the existent and non-existent capacities and the assessment of positive effects of usage of geothermal energy. At the moment, 160 long holes are being exploited whose water temperature is around 60 ??C (140 ??F) and their heat power reach 160 MJ/s. It was stated that adequate exploitation of existing and new geothermal sources a yearly would save about 500,000 tons of fossil fuels what is proportional to the 10\% of the today's heating system. The total amount of heat accumulated at geothermal deposit sites in Serbia, up to 3 km of depth, is two times greater than the total amount of heat that may be generated by burring all available coal reserves in Serbia. Price of electrical energy produced from geothermal springs is estimated to be between 9.2 US cents/kWh and 11.5 US cents/kWh. In order to support exploitation of geothermal energy (as well as all other renewable sources of energy) the decision that all the producers of energy from renewable sources get a status of privileged producers were made. ?? 2009.},

abstract = {Accurate inversion of land surface geo/biophysical variables from remote sensing data for earth observation applications is an essential and challenging topic for the global change research. Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of earth surface processes from local to global scales. The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from the space. Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) is the newest thermal infrared sensor for the Landsat project, providing two adjacent thermal bands, which has a great benefit for the LST inversion. In this paper, we compared three different approaches for LST inversion from TIRS, including the radiative transfer equation-based method, the split-window algorithm and the single channel method. Four selected energy balance monitoring sites from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) were used for validation, combining with the MODIS 8 day emissivity product. For the investigated sites and scenes, results show that the LST inverted from the radiative transfer equation-based method using band 10 has the highest accuracy with RMSE lower than 1 K, while the SW algorithm has moderate accuracy and the SC method has the lowest accuracy.},

abstract = {This study examines two mapping method's sensitivity to the sampling density of the variable of interest, which is the thickness of a silty-clay–loam (TSCL) horizon. The two methods are simple linear regression (SLR) and universal kriging with external drift (UKEXD). As slope gradient ($\beta$) derived from a DEM, is available for the whole study area and linearly related to TSCL horizon, was used for TSCL prediction by SLR and by UKEXD. The accuracy performance of TSCL prediction using these methods was assessed by comparison with another group of 69 sample points (validation sample) where the TSCL is actually measured. In the validation procedure for the two methods, two indices were calculated from the validation sample (measured values) and predicted values. These two indices are the mean error (ME) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that UKEXD was more accurate than the SLR. The improvement of the accuracy of the prediction from SLR to UKEXD was about 38\%. To examine the effect of sampling density of TSCL (variable of interest) on the performance of both mapping methods, five subsets of 40, 50, 75, 100 and 125 observation sites of TSCL were randomly selected from the 150 sites of the prediction sample. For each subset, a prediction of TSCL was performed over the study area by: (i) SLR; (ii) UKEXD. The validation sample was used to compare the performance of the two methods according to the sample size of the variable of interest. The results show that whatever the sample size may be, UKEXD performs on average more accurate predictions than SLR. Moreover, the results indicate that UKEXD performed better when the sample size of the variable of interest increases. On the contrary, the performances with the linear regression remain stable whatever the sample size may be.},

abstract = {Winter maintenance today is normally based on mechanical snow clearance together with the use of salt. The spreading of salt causes impacts on plants and the ground. Wintry traffic situations lead to reduced speeds, traffic jams and therefore to losses of time. New economical and environment-friendly solutions are needed in winter maintenance to increase road safety and mobility. Winter maintenance “from the bottom” using renewable and free geothermal heat is an obvious solution and a chance to achieve these goals. Geothermally heated outside surfaces are typically based on hydronic heat exchanger installations in the pavement. The installed heating capacity depends on the climatic conditions and the system specifications. Snow melting needs higher system temperatures than simple prevention of ice-formation. Low system temperatures implicate an anticipatory operation control. A conceptual system design takes into account all relevant heat sources that are available in the neighbourhood of the planned road heating: e.g. natural hot water, ground-water or closed-circuit systems. A number of pilot plants for geothermal snow melting and/or geothermal de-icing have been built all over the world. A well known and well documented geothermal installation is the SERSO pilot plant in central Switzerland, which went 1994 into operation and is now still running. Geothermal road, bridge or outside surface heating is a feasible and approved possibility to increase traffic and public safety. Although the initial costs are high, such systems are not uneconomical. Social and macroeconomic benefits are given.},

abstract = {The increased interest in geothermal energy has led to a desire for more sophisticated analyses of available geothermal resources for heat and power production. The evaluation methods have traditionally used 1-D models, but progress in computing power has recently allowed us to achieve joint interpretations, including the large-scale effects of geological, topographical and hydrogeological features. This paper describes the steps taken in a recent integrated assessment and evaluation of the geothermal potential of the most populated areas of Switzerland. The methodology accounts for individual utilization scenarios and is based on temperature data that have been systematically collected over many years. The state-of-the-art compilation involves comprehensive 3-D regional geological and thermal models of 20-40 km extent. Zones of significant convective flow or preferential sites for borehole heat exchanger systems (BHE) can then be identified. In contrast to the results obtained from earlier geothermal resource assessments, the existing geological, hydrogeological and petrophysical data are included in the full 3-D numerical evaluation. The first results, referred to a well-documented subsurface area in Northern Switzerland, are now available. Analysis of temperature data have confirmed the importance of these factors. © 2003 CNR.

abstract = {Land Surface Temperature (LST) is one of the key inputs for Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere transfer modeling in terrestrial ecosystems. In the frame of BIOSPEC (Linking spectral information at different spatial scales with biophysical parameters of Mediterranean vegetation in the context of global change) and FLUXPEC (Monitoring changes in water and carbon fluxes from remote and proximal sensing in Mediterranean “dehesa” ecosystem) projects LST retrieved from Landsat data is required to integrate ground-based observations of energy, water, and carbon fluxes with multi-scale remotely-sensed data and assess water and carbon balance in ecologically fragile heterogeneous ecosystem of Mediterranean wooded grassland (dehesa). Thus, three methods based on the Radiative Transfer Equation were used to extract LST from a series of 2009–2011 Landsat-5 TM images to assess the applicability for temperature input generation to a Landsat-MODIS LST integration. When compared to surface temperatures simulated using MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) with atmospheric profiles inputs (LSTref), values from Single-Channel (SC) algorithm are the closest (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.50 °C); procedure based on the online Radiative Transfer Equation Atmospheric Correction Parameters Calculator (RTE-ACPC) shows RMSD = 0.85 °C; Mono-Window algorithm (MW) presents the highest RMSD (2.34 °C) with systematical LST underestimation (bias = 1.81 °C). Differences between Landsat-retrieved LST and MODIS LST are in the range of 2 to 4 °C and can be explained mainly by differences in observation geometry, emissivity, and time mismatch between Landsat and MODIS overpasses. There is a seasonal bias in Landsat-MODIS LST differences due to greater variations in surface emissivity and thermal contrasts between landcover components.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy and the other renewable energy sources are becoming attractive solutions for clean and sustainable energy needs of Turkey. Geothermal energy is being used for electricity production and it has direct usage in Turkey, which is among the first five countries in the world for the geothermal direct usage applications. Although, Turkey is the second country to have the highest geothermal energy potential in Europe, the electricity production from geothermal energy is quite low. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the status of the geothermal energy for the electricity generation in Turkey. Currently, there is one geothermal power plant with an installed capacity of 20.4 MWe already operating in the Denizli-Kizildere geothermal field and another is under the construction in the Aydin-Germencik field. This study examines the potential and utilization of the existing geothermal energy resources in Kutahya-Simav region. The temperature of the geothermal fluid in the Simav-Eynal field is too high for the district heating system. Therefore, the possibility of electrical energy generation by a binary-cycle has been researched and the preliminary feasibility studies have been conducted in the field. For the environmental reasons, the working fluid used in this binary power plant has been chosen as HCFC-124. It has been concluded that the Kutahya-Simav geothermal power plant has the potential to produce an installed capacity of 2.9 MWe energy, and a minimum of 17,020 MWh/year electrical energy can be produced from this plant. As a conclusion, the pre-feasibility study indicates that the project is economically feasible and applicable. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A surface energy balance was conducted to calculate the latent heat flux ($\lambda$E) using aerodynamic methods and the Penman–Monteith (PM) method. Computations were based on gridded weather and Landsat satellite reflected and thermal data. The surface energy balance facilitated a comparison of impacts of different parameterizations and assumptions, while calculating $\lambda$E over large areas through the use of remote sensing. The first part of the study compares the full aerodynamic method for estimating latent heat flux against the appropriately parameterized PM method with calculation of bulk surface resistance (rs). The second part of the study compares the appropriately parameterized PM method against the PM method, with various relaxations on parameters. This study emphasizes the use of separate aerodynamic equations (latent heat flux and sensible heat flux) against the combined Penman–Monteith equation to calculate $\lambda$E when surface temperature (Ts) is much warmer than air temperature (Ta), as will occur under water stressed conditions. The study was conducted in southern Idaho for a 1000-km2 area over a range of land use classes and for two Landsat satellite overpass dates. The results show discrepancies in latent heat flux ($\lambda$E) values when the PM method is used with simplifications and relaxations, compared to the appropriately parameterized PM method and full aerodynamic method. Errors were particularly significant in areas of sparse vegetation where differences between Ts and Ta were high. The maximum RMSD between the correct PM method and simplified PM methods was about 56 W/m2 in sparsely vegetated sagebrush desert where the same surface resistance was applied.},

abstract = {Geothermal reservoirs are usually located at a depth range of 2 to 5 km, so to efficiently utilize such resources an advanced prospecting method is needed to detect these deep geologic structures. This study aimed to three-dimensionally characterize geothermal reservoirs by a combination of Magnetotelluric (MT) survey, inversion analysis of apparent resistivity, and interpolation of the resistivity data obtained. The western side of Mt. Aso crater, southwest Japan, was chosen as the case study area. Three hot springs exist there and a fault is assumed to go in the direction connecting them. A MT survey was carried out at 26 sites and the data processed by a remote reference method to reduce artificial noises. Based on skewness and Mohr circle analyses of the impedance tensor, the local geologic structure at each site could be approximated as horizontally layered and therefore, a one-dimensional inversion analysis was applied to the MT raw data. The resultant resistivity column data were then interpolated by the three-dimensional optimization principle method. The resistivity distributions obtained clarified continuous conductors with especially low resistivity (less than 10 $\Omega$·m) at the hot springs along the fault. Because the resistivity decreases largely with an abundance of clay minerals, the conductors could be considered to correspond with the cap rocks. Thus, two geothermal reservoirs, whose shapes were estimated to be pillar, were detected under the cap rocks in an elevation range of - 1000 to - 3000 m. By comparing the resistivity distributions with the temperature distributions based on fluid-flow calculations at a steady state using FEM, the validity of the location and dimension of the estimated reservoirs were confirmed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The impacts of recurrent droughts have increased vulnerability and reduced the adaptive capacity of the people living in arid and semi-arid lands (ASALS) of Kenya. Current interventions are short-term and curative in nature, hence unsustainable. Some of the most arid and semi-arid lands are located within the Kenyan Rift system, which has an estimated geothermal potential of about 7000 to 10,000 MWe, out of which only 200 MWe has been developed, and about 5000 MWe planned by 2030. Recent power sector reforms have built institutional structures that will accelerate development of geothermal energy. The paper analyses the potential use of geothermal energy resources in eastern Baringo lowlands between Lake Bogoria and Silali prospects, which has an estimated potential of >2700 MWe, in creating the necessary adjustments needed to adapt to the impacts of recurrent droughts by locals. Opportunities for direct and indirect uses of geothermal energy exist in climate vulnerable sectors, such as, agriculture, fisheries, water, livestock production as well as alternative income generating activities such as, tourism, micro enterprises, aloe, honey and beeswax production, fabric dyeing and others using resources sourced from within a 50 km radius. The possibility of accelerated geothermal development and proposed utilisation schemes in causing maladaptation if unsustainably implemented is also discussed. The paper draws a Lindal diagram adapted to the study area showing potential utilisation in the above sectors, and new flow diagram showing potential for cascaded use of geothermal hot water through the different processes. An estimated capacity of 100 MWt and 100 MWe can be used in the potential utilisation schemes discussed in this article to meet local adaptation and lighting needs and much less in a cascaded process. Potential barriers and possible solutions are also discussed. The study concludes that geothermal energy is a vital option for adaptation in the study area if sustainably used. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Air surface temperature (T air) is an important parameter for a wide range of applications such as vector-borne disease bionomics, hydrology and climate change studies. Air temperature data is usually obtained from measurements made in meteorological stations, providing only limited information about spatial patterns over wide areas. The use of remote sensing data can help overcome this problem, particularly in areas with low station density, having the potential to improve the estimation of T air at both regional and global scales. Some studies have tried to derive maximum (T max), minimum (T min) and average air temperature (T avg) using different methods, with variable estimation accuracy; errors generally fall in the 2-3??C range while the level of precision generally considered as accurate is 1-2??C. The main objective of this study was to accurately estimate T max, T min and T avg for a 10year period based on remote sensing-Land Surface Temperature (LST) data obtained from MODIS-and auxiliary data using a statistical approach. An optimization procedure with a mixed bootstrap and jackknife resampling was employed. The statistical models estimated Tavg with a MEF (Model Efficiency Index) of 0.941 and a RMSE of 1.33??C. Regarding T max and T min, the best MEF achieved was 0.919 and 0.871, respectively, with a 1.83 and 1.74??C RMSE. The developed datasets provided weekly 1km estimations and accurately described both the intra and inter annual temporal and spatial patterns of T air. Potential sources of uncertainty and error were also analyzed and identified. The most promising developments were proposed with the aim of developing accurate T air estimations at a larger scale in the future. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper defines the maximum possible vertical extent of hydrothermal circulation in granitic crust, and thus the maximum depth within which geothermal reservoirs can be encountered. To evaluate prospective geothermal fields we constructed a geothermal database in northern Honshu, Japan that includes 571 points of thermal data of existing wells and hot springs. Depth-temperature curves were normalized by the Activity Index for three-dimensional extrapolation and a depth contour map of the 380 °C isotherm was plotted as an assumed brittle-plastic transition for granitic crust. Shallower-depth anomalies of the brittle-plastic transition on this map are closely coincident with the Quaternary volcanoes and their prospective geothermal fields. It should be noted that the bottom of the spatial distribution of seismicity in the volcanic fields shows strong correlation to the 380 °C isotherm. This result indicates reliability of the subsurface three-dimensional thermal map and suggests that the 380 °C isotherm strongly constrains the bottom surface of seismicity, fracturing and hydrothermal convection in granitic crust.},

abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of land surface processes from local through global scales. The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from space. However, retrieving LST is still a challenging task since the LST retrieval problem is ill-posed. This paper reviews the current status of selected remote sensing algorithms for estimating LST from thermal infrared (TIR) data. A brief theoretical background of the subject is presented along with a survey of the algorithms employed for obtaining LST from space-based TIR measurements. The discussion focuses on TIR data acquired from polar-orbiting satellites because of their widespread use, global applicability and higher spatial resolution compared to geostationary satellites. The theoretical framework and methodologies used to derive the LST from the data are reviewed followed by the methodologies for validating satellite-derived LST. Directions for future research to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived LST are then suggested.},

abstract = {The accurate imaging of geothermal systems from the ground surface down to great depths is an interdisciplinary problem common to geothermal resource exploration and development. Rocks can be characterized mainly in terms of their lithology, mineralogy, fracture distribution, permeability, thermal conductivity and porosity, and similarly the geothermal fluid (and its circulation) by its geochemistry, flow pattern, velocity, temperature and pressure. Some of these data are obtained by well logging and from laboratory tests conducted on drillhole cores. In general, the distribution of geothermal wells is not random, and well data are limited in terms of quantity and depth range. Accordingly, a sophisticated spatial modeling technique is indispensable in the three-dimensional imaging of geothermal systems. We describe a versatile 3-D modeling method that can be used to determine the temperature, flow velocity, and distribution of geological units within a geothermal field based on well log data. The model results for the Hohi geothermal area, Japan, provide plausible estimates of temperature, flow velocity, and geology to a depth of 3000 m. Superimposition of the three spatial models we obtained shows that, at Hohi, two geothermal reservoirs are localized near highly fractured fault zones that provide paths for the ascent of thermal fluids from depth. © 2007 CNR.},

abstract = {Geothermal resources have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy for electrical power generation worldwide. Combined 3D SST and LST measurements are essential for accurate assessment of geothermal resources. In this study, subsurface and surface temperature distributions were combined using a dataset comprised of well logs and TIR images from Hokkaido island, northern Japan. Using 28,476 temperature data points from 433 boreholes sites and a method of KED, SST distribution model from depths of 100 to 1500 m was produced. Regional LST was estimated from 13 scenes of Landsat 8 images. Resultant SST ranged from around 50 C to 300 C at a depth of 1500 m. Most of western and part of the eastern Hokkaido are characterized by high temperature gradients, while low temperatures were found in the central region. Higher temperatures in shallower crust imply the western region and part of the eastern region have high geothermal potential. Moreover, several LST zones considered to have high geothermal potential were identified upon clarification of the underground heat distribution according to 3D SST. LST in these zones showed the anomalies, 3 to 9 C higher than the surrounding areas. These results demonstrate that our combination of TIR and 3D temperature modeling using well logging and geostatistics is an efficient and promising approach to geothermal resource exploration.},

@article{Petrunin2013,
abstract = {At the Earth’s surface, heat fluxes from the interior are generally insignificant compared with those from the Sun and atmosphere, except in areas permanently blanketed by ice. Modelling studies show that geothermal heat flux influences the internal thermal structure of ice sheets and the distribution of basal melt water, and it should be taken into account in planning deep ice drilling campaigns and climate reconstructions. Here we use a coupled ice–lithosphere model driven by climate and show that the oldest and thickest part of the Greenland Ice Sheet is strongly influenced by heat flow from the deep Earth. We find that the geothermal heat flux in central Greenland increases from west to east due to thinning of the lithosphere, which is only about 25–66\% as thick as is typical for terrains of early Proterozoic age. Complex interactions between geothermal heat flow and glaciation-induced thermal perturbations in the upper crust over glacial cycles lead to strong regional variations in basal ice conditions, with areas of rapid basal melting adjoining areas of extremely cold basal ice. Our findings demonstrate the role that the structure of the solid Earth plays in the dynamics of surface processes.},

New data have been taken from WGC2010 country update reports, private communications from IGA members and affiliated organizations. Other updates have been collected from websites of private and public organizations involved in geothermal development. Plants commissioned in 2010 (after WGC2010) have been included in the installed capacity, even though their produced energy has not been accounted for. An increase of about 2GW (herein we use MW and GW for the electrical capacity and MWth and GWth for thermal capacity) in the five year term 2005-2010 has been achieved (about 22\%), following the rough linear trend of approximately 400MW/year, with an evident increase of the average value of about 200MW/year in the 2000-2005 period (Bertani, 2005a,b, 2006, 2007). The most significant data to be highlighted from this paper are:???a total of 24 countries now generate electricity from geothermal resources;???the total installed capacity worldwide is 10,898MW, corresponding to about 67,246GWh of electricity (early 2010 data);???Germany, Papua - New Guinea, Australia, Turkey, Iceland, Portugal, New Zealand, Guatemala, Kenya, and Indonesia have increased the capacity of their power plant installations by more than 50\% with respect to the year 2005;???the top five countries for their electricity production are USA, Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico and Italy;???five countries realized an increase above 100MW with respect to 2005: USA, Indonesia, Iceland, New Zealand and Kenya.The prospective for growth during 2010-2015 are good, with a strong possibility of realizing a big increase in the installed capacity up to 19.

The depressions are elongated in a direction roughly perpen- dicular to the axis of maximum coseismic extension. A high concentration of Late Cenozoic calderas7, high heat flow8, hot thermal waters9, and young and hot granite10 in the subsided regions imply the presence of magmatic and hot plutonic bodies beneath the volcanoes, that may have deformed and subsided in response to stress changes associated with the Tohoku earthquake along with the surrounding, thermally weakened host rocks.

abstract = {We present the first quantitative representation of the intensity of Yellowstone National Park's surficial geothermal activity mapped continuously in space. A radiative thermal anomaly was remotely sensed throughout a 19,682-km2 landscape covering Yellowstone National Park in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. The anomaly is the residual terrestrial emittance measured using the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper after accounting for elevation and solar effects, and was hypothesized to be an estimator of a lower bound for geothermal heat flux (GHF). Continuous variations in the anomaly were measured ranging from 0??W m- 2 up to a maximum heat flux of at least 94??W m- 2 (at the 28.5??m pixel scale). An independent method was developed for measuring GHF at smaller scales, based on inversion of a snowpack simulation model, combined with field mapping of snow-free perimeters around selected geothermal features. These perimeters were assumed to be approximately isothermal, with a mean GHF estimated as the minimum heat flux required to ablate the simulated snowpack at that location on the day of field survey. The remotely sensed thermal anomaly correlated well (r = 0.82) with the snowpack-inversion measurements, and supported the hypothesis that the anomaly estimates a lower bound for GHF. These methods enable natural resource managers to identify, quantify and predict changes in heat flux over time in geothermally active areas. They also provide a quantitative basis for understanding the degree to which Yellowstone's famous wildlife herds are actually dependent on geothermal activity. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Interest in geothermal energy originated in Iran when James R. McNitt, a United Nations geothermal expert, visited the country in December 1974. In 1975, a contract among the Ministry of Energy, ENEL (Entes Nazionale per L'Energia Elettrica) of Italy and TB (Tehran Berkeley) of Iran was signed for geothermal exploration in the north-western part of Iran. In 1983, the result of investigations defined Sabalan, Damavand, Khoy-Maku and Sahand regions as four prospected geothermal sites in north-western Iran. From 1996 to 1999, a countrywide geothermal energy resource exploration project was carried out by Renewable Energy Organization of Iran (SUNA) and 10 more potential areas were indicated additionally. Geothermal potential site selection using Geographic Information System (GIS) was carried out in Kyushu University in 2007. The results indicated 8.8\% of Iran as prospected geothermal areas in 18 fields. Sabalan as a first priority of geothermal potential regions was selected for detailed explorations. Since 1995, surface exploration and feasibility studies have been carried out and five promising areas were defined. Among those prospective areas, Northwest Sabalan geothermal filed was defined for detailed exploration to justify exploration drilling and to estimate the reservoir characteristics and capacity. From 2002 to 2004, three deep exploration wells were drilled for evaluation of subsurface geological conditions, geothermal reservoir assessment and response simulation. Two of the wells were successful and a maximum temperature of 240 °C at a depth of 3197 m was recorded. As a result of the reservoir simulation, a 55-MW power plant is projected to be installed in the Sabalan field as a first in geothermal power generation. To supply the required steam for the geothermal power plant (GPP) 17 deep production and reinjection wells are planned to be drilled this year. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An interpolation method based on a multilayer neural network (MNN), has been examined and tested for the data of irregular sample locations. The main advantage of MNN is in that it can deal with geoscience data with nonlinear behavior and extract characteristics from complex and noisy images. The training of MNN is used to modify connection weights between nodes located in different layers by a simulated annealing algorithm (one of the optimization algorithms of the network). In this process, three types of errors are considered: differences in values, semivariograms, and gradients between sample data and outputs from the trained network. The training is continued until the summation of these errors converges to an acceptably small value. Because the MNN trained by this learning criterion can estimate a value at an arbitrary location, this method is a form of kriging and termed Neural Kriging (NK). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of NK, a problem on restoration ability of a defined reference surface from randomly chosen discrete data was prepared. Two types of surfaces, whose semivariograms are expressed by isotropic spherical and geometric anisotropic gaussian models, were examined in this problem. Though the interpolation accuracy depended on the arrangement pattern of the sample locations for the same number of data, the interpolation errors of NK were shown to be smaller than both those of ordinary MNN and ordinal kriging. NK can also produce a contour map in consideration of gradient constraints. Furthermore, NK was applied to distribution analysis of subsurface temperatures using geothermal investigation loggings of the Hohi area in southwest Japan. In spite of the restricted quantity of sample data, the interpolation results revealed high temperature zones and convection patterns of hydrothermal fluids. NK is regarded as an interpolation method with high accuracy that can be used for regionalized variables with any structure of spatial correlation.},

abstract = {The steep topography of mountain landscapes arises from interactions among tectonic rock uplift, valley incision and landslide erosion on hillslopes. Hillslopes in rapidly uplifting landscapes are thought to respond to river incision into bedrock by steepening to a maximum stable or ‘threshold’ angle. Landslide erosion rates are predicted to increase nonlinearly as hillslope angles approach the threshold angle. However, the key tenet of this emerging threshold hillslope model of landscape evolution—the coupled response of landslide erosion to tectonic and fluvial forcing—remains untested. Here we quantify landslide erosion rates in the eastern Himalaya, based on mapping more than 15,000 landslides on satellite images. We show that landslide erosion rates are significantly correlated with exhumation rates and stream power and that small increases in mean hillslope angles beyond 30° translate into large and significant increases in landslide erosion. Extensive landsliding in response to a large outburst flood indicates that lateral river erosion is a key driver of landslide erosion on threshold hillslopes. Our results confirm the existence of threshold hillslopes and demonstrate that an increase in landslide erosion rates, rather than steepened hillslope angles, is the primary mechanism by which steep uplands respond to and balance rapid rates of rock uplift and bedrock river incision in tectonically active mountain belts.},

This analysis will help determine how we can enlarge and diversify the portfolio of options we should be vigorously pursuing. One such option that is often ignored is geothermal energy, produced from both conventional hydrothermal and Enhanced (or engineered) Geothermal Systems (EGS). An 18-member assessment panel was assembled in September 2005 to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of EGS becoming a major supplier of primary energy for U.S. base-load generation capacity by 2050. This report documents the work of the panel at three separate levels of detail. The first is a Synopsis, which provides a brief overview of the scope, motivation, approach, major findings, and recommendations of the panel. At the second level, an Executive Summary reviews each component of the study, providing major results and findings. The third level provides full documentation in eight chapters, with each detailing the scope, approach, and results of the analysis and modeling conducted in each area.},

abstract = {Turkey is an energy importing nation with more than half of our energy requirements met by imported fuels. Air pollution is becoming a significant environmental concern in the country. In this regard, geothermal energy and other renewable energy sources are becoming attractive solution for clean and sustainable energy future for Turkey. Turkey is the seventh richest country in the world in geothermal energy potential. The main uses of geothermal energy are space heating and domestic hot water supply, greenhouse heating, industrial processes, heat pumps and electricity generation. The district heating system applications started with large-scale, city-based geothermal district heating systems in Turkey, whereas the geothermal district heating centre and distribution networks have been designed according to the geothermal district heating system (GDHS) parameters. This constitutes an important advantage of GDHS investments in the country in terms of the technical and economical aspects. In Turkey, approximately 61,000 residences are currently heated by geothermal fluids. A total of 665 MWt is utilized for space heating of residential, public and private property, and 565,000 m2 of greenhouses. The proven geothermal heat capacity, according to data from existing geothermal wells and natural discharges, is 3132 MWt. Present applications have shown that geothermal energy is clean and much cheaper compared to the other fossil and renewable energy sources for Turkey. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Underground mines are extremely capital intensive, but despite this investment the traditional view has been that they have little useful value after closure. There are, however, potential positive uses of closed mines, in particular the generation of renewable geothermal energy. After closure, many mines flood and the relatively stable temperature of this water can be exploited by the use of geothermal recovery loops coupled to heat pumps. A review of the current situation, despite increasing pressures to identify sources of renewable energy, reveals that there are still only a limited number of existing and proposed installations. Nevertheless, a survey of those that do exist demonstrates the potential value of this approach. In particular, during the winter heat can be extracted from mine water and supplied for space heating, and in the summer the process can be reversed and the heat transferred back to the water to provide cooling. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Muffler1978Geothermics,
abstract = {A consistent, agreed-upon terminology is prerequisite for geothermal resource assessment. Accordingly, we propose a logical, sequential subdivision of the “geothermal resource base”, accepting its definition as all the thermal energy in the earth's crust under a given area, measured from mean annual temperature. That part of the resource base which is shallow enough to be tapped by production drilling is termed the “accessible resource base”, and it in turn is divided into “useful” and “residual” components. The useful component (i.e. the thermal energy that could reasonably be extracted at costs competitive with other forms of energy at some specified future time) is termed the “geothermal resource”. This in turn is divided into “economic” and “subeconomic” components, based on conditions existing at the time of assessment. In the format of a McKelvey diagram, this logic defines the vertical axis (degree of economic feasibility). The horizontal axis (degree of geologic assurance) contains “identified” and “undiscovered” components. “Reserve” is then designated as the identified economic resource. All categories should be expressed in units of thermal energy, with resource and reserve figures calculated at wellhead, prior to the inevitable large losses inherent in any practical thermal use or in conversion to electricity. Methods for assessing geothermal resources can be grouped into 4 classes: (a) surface thermal flux, (b) volume, (c) planar fracture and (d) magmatic heat budget. The volume method appears to be most useful because (1) it is applicable to virtually any geologic environment, (2) the required parameters can in Sprinciple be measured or estimated, (3) the inevitable errors are in part compensated and (4) the major uncertainties (recoverability and resupply) are amenable to resolution in the foreseeable future. The major weakness in all the methods rests in the estimation of how much of the accessible resource base can be extracted at some time in the future. In a manner similar to mineral and fuel assessment, this recoverability is expressed as a “recovery factor”. For an ideally permeable hot-water system, the recovery factor may be as much as 50\% and seems to be independent of temperature. It must decrease as effective porosity ($\phi$e) decreases, but the relation between the two is little more than a guess. On the other hand, for favorable systems like Larderello that produce steam by a mechanism of intergranular vaporization, the recovery factor is probably around 15–20\%, decreasing to zero at an effective porosity of zero. According to the anlysis of Bodvarsson (1974), it increases with decreasing reservoir temperature, and as pointed out by Nathenson (1975a) is limited at low temperatures by the need to have sufficient reservoir pressure for extraction and use. The extent to which a geothermal reservoir can be resupplied with heat during “industrial” times of 10–100 yr can be evaluated using simple analytical models. The results, combined with gravity and levelling data of Hunt (1977) for Wairakei and Isherwood (1977) for The Geysers, confirm earlier conclusions by Ramey (1970) and Nathenson (1975a) that resupply to reservoirs producing only steam can be neglected, and the conclusion of Nathenson (1975a) that it may be significant for hot-water systems of high natural discharge. Major subjects that demand continuing investigation include: 1.1. Determination of recovery factors as functions of temperature and effective porosity, particularly for hot-water systems.2.2. Evaluation of fluid recharge and heat resupply by repetitive gravity, levelling and underground temperature surveys in producing geothermal fields.3.3. Analysis of the extent to which a recovery factor can be enhanced by stimulation and by use of confined circulation loops.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth's interior. The paper describes the internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside the mantle and crust. It also shows the location of geothermal fields on specific areas of the Earth. The Earth's heat flow and geothermal gradient are defined, as well as the types of geothermal fields, the geologic environment of geothermal energy, and the methods for geothermal exploration Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades to generate electricity, both in space heating and industrial processes. The geothermal electrical installed capacity in the world is 7173.5 MWe (December 1996), and the electrical energy generated is 38 billion kW h/year, representing 0.4\% of the world total electrical energy which was 13,267 billion kWh in 1995. The thermal capacity in non-electrical uses (greenhouses, aquaculture, district heating, industrial processes) is 8664 MW1 (end of 1994). Electricity is produced with an efficiency of 10–17\%, and the geothermal kWh is generally cost-competitive with conventional sources of energy, in the range 3–12 US cents/kWh. The geothermal electrical capacity installed in the world is probably comparable with that from biomass. but almost twice that from solar or wind sources summed together. In developing countries, where total installed electrical power is still low, geothermal energy can play a significant role: in El Salvador 15\% of electricity comes from geothermal steam, 15\% in Nicaragua. 21\% in the Philippines, and 6\% in Kenya and Costa Rica. Financial investments in geothermal electrical and non-electrical uses worldwide are summarised. Present technology makes it possible to control the environmental impact of geothermal exploitation. The future use of the geothermal energy from advanced technologies such as the exploitation of geopressured reservoirs, hot dry rock systems and magma bodies is briefly discussed. While the viability of hot dry rock technology has been proved., research and development are still necessary for the other two sources. Finally, a brief discussion follows on training of specialists, geothermal literature, on-line information, and geothermal associations. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd},
