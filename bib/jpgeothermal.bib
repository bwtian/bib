abstract = {Interest in geothermal energy originated in Iran when James R. McNitt, a United Nations geothermal expert, visited the country in December 1974. In 1975, a contract among the Ministry of Energy, ENEL (Entes Nazionale per L'Energia Elettrica) of Italy and TB (Tehran Berkeley) of Iran was signed for geothermal exploration in the north-western part of Iran. In 1983, the result of investigations defined Sabalan, Damavand, Khoy-Maku and Sahand regions as four prospected geothermal sites in north-western Iran. From 1996 to 1999, a countrywide geothermal energy resource exploration project was carried out by Renewable Energy Organization of Iran (SUNA) and 10 more potential areas were indicated additionally. Geothermal potential site selection using Geographic Information System (GIS) was carried out in Kyushu University in 2007. The results indicated 8.8\% of Iran as prospected geothermal areas in 18 fields. Sabalan as a first priority of geothermal potential regions was selected for detailed explorations. Since 1995, surface exploration and feasibility studies have been carried out and five promising areas were defined. Among those prospective areas, Northwest Sabalan geothermal filed was defined for detailed exploration to justify exploration drilling and to estimate the reservoir characteristics and capacity. From 2002 to 2004, three deep exploration wells were drilled for evaluation of subsurface geological conditions, geothermal reservoir assessment and response simulation. Two of the wells were successful and a maximum temperature of 240 °C at a depth of 3197 m was recorded. As a result of the reservoir simulation, a 55-MW power plant is projected to be installed in the Sabalan field as a first in geothermal power generation. To supply the required steam for the geothermal power plant (GPP) 17 deep production and reinjection wells are planned to be drilled this year. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Turkey is an energy importing nation with more than half of our energy requirements met by imported fuels. Air pollution is becoming a significant environmental concern in the country. In this regard, geothermal energy and other renewable energy sources are becoming attractive solution for clean and sustainable energy future for Turkey. Turkey is the seventh richest country in the world in geothermal energy potential. The main uses of geothermal energy are space heating and domestic hot water supply, greenhouse heating, industrial processes, heat pumps and electricity generation. The district heating system applications started with large-scale, city-based geothermal district heating systems in Turkey, whereas the geothermal district heating centre and distribution networks have been designed according to the geothermal district heating system (GDHS) parameters. This constitutes an important advantage of GDHS investments in the country in terms of the technical and economical aspects. In Turkey, approximately 61,000 residences are currently heated by geothermal fluids. A total of 665 MWt is utilized for space heating of residential, public and private property, and 565,000 m2 of greenhouses. The proven geothermal heat capacity, according to data from existing geothermal wells and natural discharges, is 3132 MWt. Present applications have shown that geothermal energy is clean and much cheaper compared to the other fossil and renewable energy sources for Turkey. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Underground mines are extremely capital intensive, but despite this investment the traditional view has been that they have little useful value after closure. There are, however, potential positive uses of closed mines, in particular the generation of renewable geothermal energy. After closure, many mines flood and the relatively stable temperature of this water can be exploited by the use of geothermal recovery loops coupled to heat pumps. A review of the current situation, despite increasing pressures to identify sources of renewable energy, reveals that there are still only a limited number of existing and proposed installations. Nevertheless, a survey of those that do exist demonstrates the potential value of this approach. In particular, during the winter heat can be extracted from mine water and supplied for space heating, and in the summer the process can be reversed and the heat transferred back to the water to provide cooling. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Shallow geothermal energy (<400 m depth) is used in many countries worldwide, with a rising number of installations over the last decades. The use of ground source heat pump (GSHP) and groundwater heat pump (GWHP) systems results in local temperature anomalies (cold or heat plumes). Since groundwater is used in many countries as source for drinking water a balance between its use and protection has to be found. Therefore, to avoid detrimental environmental impacts it is necessary to define groundwater temperature limits for heating and cooling and minimum distances between such geothermal systems. The aim of the present study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current international legal status for the use of shallow geothermal energy. Therefore, an international survey was performed using a questionnaire, which was sent to more than 60 countries worldwide. The questionnaire requested information on the corresponding national legislation, temperature limits and minimum distances for GSHP and GWHP systems. The answers to the inquiry showed an extremely heterogeneous outcome. Until now national and legally binding regulations only exist in few countries such as Denmark or Sweden. However, all existing regulations show a wide range for minimum distances (5-300 m) and temperature limits for groundwater. The highest inconsistency was observed for the acceptable temperature change with 3 K in Switzerland to 11 K in France. However, most countries have no legally binding regulations or even guidelines, which highlight the urgent need for further research on the environmental impact and legal management of shallow geothermal installations. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Geothermal energy and the other renewable energy sources are becoming attractive solutions for clean and sustainable energy needs of Turkey. Geothermal energy is being used for electricity production and it has direct usage in Turkey, which is among the first five countries in the world for the geothermal direct usage applications. Although, Turkey is the second country to have the highest geothermal energy potential in Europe, the electricity production from geothermal energy is quite low. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the status of the geothermal energy for the electricity generation in Turkey. Currently, there is one geothermal power plant with an installed capacity of 20.4 MWe already operating in the Denizli-Kizildere geothermal field and another is under the construction in the Aydin-Germencik field. This study examines the potential and utilization of the existing geothermal energy resources in Kutahya-Simav region. The temperature of the geothermal fluid in the Simav-Eynal field is too high for the district heating system. Therefore, the possibility of electrical energy generation by a binary-cycle has been researched and the preliminary feasibility studies have been conducted in the field. For the environmental reasons, the working fluid used in this binary power plant has been chosen as HCFC-124. It has been concluded that the Kutahya-Simav geothermal power plant has the potential to produce an installed capacity of 2.9 MWe energy, and a minimum of 17,020 MWh/year electrical energy can be produced from this plant. As a conclusion, the pre-feasibility study indicates that the project is economically feasible and applicable. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Turkey is one of the countries with significant potential in geothermal energy. It is estimated that if Turkey utilizes all of her geothermal potential, she can meet 14\% of her total energy need (heat and electricity) from geothermal sources. Therefore, today geothermal energy is an attractive option in Turkey to replace fossil fuels. Besides, increase in negative effects of fossil fuels on the environment has forced many countries, including Turkey, to use renewable energy sources. Also, Turkey is an energy importing country; more than two-thirds of her energy requirement is supplied by imports. In this context, geothermal energy appears to be one of the most efficient and effective solutions for sustainable energy development and environmental pollution prevention in Turkey. Since geothermal energy will be used more and more in the future, its current potential, usage, and assessment in Turkey is the focus of the present study. The paper not only presents a review of the potential and utilization of the geothermal energy in Turkey but also provides some guidelines for policy makers. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Geothermal energy source, one of the viable renewable energy sources, has encouraging potential to generate full base-load electricity, which has not been explored so far in Pakistan. Though the country can be benefited by harnessing the hydro-geothermal options of energy generation in areas where sources exist, but most of these sources lie in extreme remote and inaccessible rugged mountainous ranges away from the urban-industrial centers. On the other hand, the present study shows that the HDR geothermal option is one of the most viable renewable sources considering the tectonic setup of Pakistan. Results of the study highlight the HDR geothermal energy prospects at relatively deeper depths than hydro-geothermal resources in water-free condition. The basement tectonic analyses reveal that the HDR prospects could be found even just below the urban-industrial centers of Pakistan where there are no hot springs and/or geysers like southern Indus basin in Sindh province or the Kharan trough in the western Balochistan province. Presence of high earth-skin temperature gradient trends derived from satellite temperature data and the high geothermal gradient anomalous zone derived from scanty data of bottom-hole temperatures of some of the oil and gas exploratory wells, indicates encouraging prospects for HDR energy sources in southern Indus and Thar Desert regions inclusive of Karachi synclinorium area. These high geothermal gradients have been inferred to be the result of the deep-seated southern Indus and the Thar fossil-rift structures. Moreover, the prospects of the HDR geothermal energy sources have also been inferred in the Chagai Arc region and the Kharan-Panjgur tectonic depression in the western part of Pakistan based on the analysis of integrated geophysical data. If HDR prospects are developed, they can offer the sustainable, CO2-free and independent of time, of day, of weather or season, and the base-load energy-generation resource. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The impacts of recurrent droughts have increased vulnerability and reduced the adaptive capacity of the people living in arid and semi-arid lands (ASALS) of Kenya. Current interventions are short-term and curative in nature, hence unsustainable. Some of the most arid and semi-arid lands are located within the Kenyan Rift system, which has an estimated geothermal potential of about 7000 to 10,000 MWe, out of which only 200 MWe has been developed, and about 5000 MWe planned by 2030. Recent power sector reforms have built institutional structures that will accelerate development of geothermal energy. The paper analyses the potential use of geothermal energy resources in eastern Baringo lowlands between Lake Bogoria and Silali prospects, which has an estimated potential of >2700 MWe, in creating the necessary adjustments needed to adapt to the impacts of recurrent droughts by locals. Opportunities for direct and indirect uses of geothermal energy exist in climate vulnerable sectors, such as, agriculture, fisheries, water, livestock production as well as alternative income generating activities such as, tourism, micro enterprises, aloe, honey and beeswax production, fabric dyeing and others using resources sourced from within a 50 km radius. The possibility of accelerated geothermal development and proposed utilisation schemes in causing maladaptation if unsustainably implemented is also discussed. The paper draws a Lindal diagram adapted to the study area showing potential utilisation in the above sectors, and new flow diagram showing potential for cascaded use of geothermal hot water through the different processes. An estimated capacity of 100 MWt and 100 MWe can be used in the potential utilisation schemes discussed in this article to meet local adaptation and lighting needs and much less in a cascaded process. Potential barriers and possible solutions are also discussed. The study concludes that geothermal energy is a vital option for adaptation in the study area if sustainably used. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {At the Earth’s surface, heat fluxes from the interior are generally insignificant compared with those from the Sun and atmosphere, except in areas permanently blanketed by ice. Modelling studies show that geothermal heat flux influences the internal thermal structure of ice sheets and the distribution of basal melt water, and it should be taken into account in planning deep ice drilling campaigns and climate reconstructions. Here we use a coupled ice–lithosphere model driven by climate and show that the oldest and thickest part of the Greenland Ice Sheet is strongly influenced by heat flow from the deep Earth. We find that the geothermal heat flux in central Greenland increases from west to east due to thinning of the lithosphere, which is only about 25–66\% as thick as is typical for terrains of early Proterozoic age. Complex interactions between geothermal heat flow and glaciation-induced thermal perturbations in the upper crust over glacial cycles lead to strong regional variations in basal ice conditions, with areas of rapid basal melting adjoining areas of extremely cold basal ice. Our findings demonstrate the role that the structure of the solid Earth plays in the dynamics of surface processes.},

abstract = {Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth's interior. The paper describes the internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside the mantle and crust. It also shows the location of geothermal fields on specific areas of the Earth. The Earth's heat flow and geothermal gradient are defined, as well as the types of geothermal fields, the geologic environment of geothermal energy, and the methods for geothermal exploration Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades to generate electricity, both in space heating and industrial processes. The geothermal electrical installed capacity in the world is 7173.5 MWe (December 1996), and the electrical energy generated is 38 billion kW h/year, representing 0.4\% of the world total electrical energy which was 13,267 billion kWh in 1995. The thermal capacity in non-electrical uses (greenhouses, aquaculture, district heating, industrial processes) is 8664 MW1 (end of 1994). Electricity is produced with an efficiency of 10–17\%, and the geothermal kWh is generally cost-competitive with conventional sources of energy, in the range 3–12 US cents/kWh. The geothermal electrical capacity installed in the world is probably comparable with that from biomass. but almost twice that from solar or wind sources summed together. In developing countries, where total installed electrical power is still low, geothermal energy can play a significant role: in El Salvador 15\% of electricity comes from geothermal steam, 15\% in Nicaragua. 21\% in the Philippines, and 6\% in Kenya and Costa Rica. Financial investments in geothermal electrical and non-electrical uses worldwide are summarised. Present technology makes it possible to control the environmental impact of geothermal exploitation. The future use of the geothermal energy from advanced technologies such as the exploitation of geopressured reservoirs, hot dry rock systems and magma bodies is briefly discussed. While the viability of hot dry rock technology has been proved., research and development are still necessary for the other two sources. Finally, a brief discussion follows on training of specialists, geothermal literature, on-line information, and geothermal associations. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd},

The volcanic regions subsided by 5–15 cm, forming elliptical depressions with horizontal dimensions of up to 15–20 km. The depressions are elongated in a direction roughly perpen- dicular to the axis of maximum coseismic extension. A high concentration of Late Cenozoic calderas7, high heat flow8, hot thermal waters9, and young and hot granite10 in the subsided regions imply the presence of magmatic and hot plutonic bodies beneath the volcanoes, that may have deformed and subsided in response to stress changes associated with the Tohoku earthquake along with the surrounding, thermally weakened host rocks. Similar subsidence observed in Chile following the 2010 Maule earthquake11 indicates that earthquake-triggered subsidence could be widespread in active volcanic chains along subduction zones.},

abstract = {The impacts of recurrent droughts have increased vulnerability and reduced the adaptive capacity of the people living in arid and semi-arid lands (ASALS) of Kenya. Current interventions are short-term and curative in nature, hence unsustainable. Some of the most arid and semi-arid lands are located within the Kenyan Rift system, which has an estimated geothermal potential of about 7000 to 10,000 MWe, out of which only 200 MWe has been developed, and about 5000 MWe planned by 2030. Recent power sector reforms have built institutional structures that will accelerate development of geothermal energy. The paper analyses the potential use of geothermal energy resources in eastern Baringo lowlands between Lake Bogoria and Silali prospects, which has an estimated potential of >2700 MWe, in creating the necessary adjustments needed to adapt to the impacts of recurrent droughts by locals. Opportunities for direct and indirect uses of geothermal energy exist in climate vulnerable sectors, such as, agriculture, fisheries, water, livestock production as well as alternative income generating activities such as, tourism, micro enterprises, aloe, honey and beeswax production, fabric dyeing and others using resources sourced from within a 50 km radius. The possibility of accelerated geothermal development and proposed utilisation schemes in causing maladaptation if unsustainably implemented is also discussed. The paper draws a Lindal diagram adapted to the study area showing potential utilisation in the above sectors, and new flow diagram showing potential for cascaded use of geothermal hot water through the different processes. An estimated capacity of 100 MWt and 100 MWe can be used in the potential utilisation schemes discussed in this article to meet local adaptation and lighting needs and much less in a cascaded process. Potential barriers and possible solutions are also discussed. The study concludes that geothermal energy is a vital option for adaptation in the study area if sustainably used. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The steep topography of mountain landscapes arises from interactions among tectonic rock uplift, valley incision and landslide erosion on hillslopes. Hillslopes in rapidly uplifting landscapes are thought to respond to river incision into bedrock by steepening to a maximum stable or ‘threshold’ angle. Landslide erosion rates are predicted to increase nonlinearly as hillslope angles approach the threshold angle. However, the key tenet of this emerging threshold hillslope model of landscape evolution—the coupled response of landslide erosion to tectonic and fluvial forcing—remains untested. Here we quantify landslide erosion rates in the eastern Himalaya, based on mapping more than 15,000 landslides on satellite images. We show that landslide erosion rates are significantly correlated with exhumation rates and stream power and that small increases in mean hillslope angles beyond 30° translate into large and significant increases in landslide erosion. Extensive landsliding in response to a large outburst flood indicates that lateral river erosion is a key driver of landslide erosion on threshold hillslopes. Our results confirm the existence of threshold hillslopes and demonstrate that an increase in landslide erosion rates, rather than steepened hillslope angles, is the primary mechanism by which steep uplands respond to and balance rapid rates of rock uplift and bedrock river incision in tectonically active mountain belts.},

More specifically, it focuses on school units that are connected to the natural gas network and on the economic and environmental benefits arising from this. In this context, the advantages and disadvantages in using natural gas are compared with those resulting from the use of geothermal energy. In areas which have a significant geothermal potential, the choice of geothermal heating and cooling of large school units is the best solution, but this however does not apply to all areas. Clearly, the development of geothermal energy in school units is still in pilot stage. However, the use of natural gas in school units has been rising over the last decade and it has already contributed to some extent towards the reduction of carbon dioxide and towards saving natural resources. Thus, the survey shows clear advantages in using natural gas and in plans to extend its use to other school units. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Serbia, as a European country in its early stage of development, is trying to synchronize its progress with experience of other countries from the field of sustainable development and in accordance with rules in the field of energetic and energetic efficiency, and, as well as to promote and develop the sector of use of renewable sources of energy. On the other hand, Serbia is a country which largely depends on import of all forms of energy, which to a great extent affects its economic stability. Therefore, in Serbia the strategy for development of energetic was imposed and it considers all the aspects of development of energetic until 2015 and it also defines the priorities which can be mostly seen in the choice of forms of alternative sources of energy. These sources, based on some criteria, can be considered the most convenient for a gradual substitution of energy which is gotten from the conventional sources. Taking into account strategically defined goals and domestic potentials which are at disposal, as well as economic parameters, an alternative source of energy of basic importance for the future exploitation on the territory of Serbia geothermal energy, was chosen. The research points to the fact that Serbia will be capable to respond adequately to Kyoto protocol demands and to the European rules regarding the substitution of a certain amounts of fossil fuels by the fuel origin from the raw biological materials. The research defines the existent and non-existent capacities and the assessment of positive effects of usage of geothermal energy. At the moment, 160 long holes are being exploited whose water temperature is around 60 ??C (140 ??F) and their heat power reach 160 MJ/s. It was stated that adequate exploitation of existing and new geothermal sources a yearly would save about 500,000 tons of fossil fuels what is proportional to the 10\% of the today's heating system. The total amount of heat accumulated at geothermal deposit sites in Serbia, up to 3 km of depth, is two times greater than the total amount of heat that may be generated by burring all available coal reserves in Serbia. Price of electrical energy produced from geothermal springs is estimated to be between 9.2 US cents/kWh and 11.5 US cents/kWh. In order to support exploitation of geothermal energy (as well as all other renewable sources of energy) the decision that all the producers of energy from renewable sources get a status of privileged producers were made. ?? 2009.},

abstract = {Winter maintenance today is normally based on mechanical snow clearance together with the use of salt. The spreading of salt causes impacts on plants and the ground. Wintry traffic situations lead to reduced speeds, traffic jams and therefore to losses of time. New economical and environment-friendly solutions are needed in winter maintenance to increase road safety and mobility. Winter maintenance “from the bottom” using renewable and free geothermal heat is an obvious solution and a chance to achieve these goals. Geothermally heated outside surfaces are typically based on hydronic heat exchanger installations in the pavement. The installed heating capacity depends on the climatic conditions and the system specifications. Snow melting needs higher system temperatures than simple prevention of ice-formation. Low system temperatures implicate an anticipatory operation control. A conceptual system design takes into account all relevant heat sources that are available in the neighbourhood of the planned road heating: e.g. natural hot water, ground-water or closed-circuit systems. A number of pilot plants for geothermal snow melting and/or geothermal de-icing have been built all over the world. A well known and well documented geothermal installation is the SERSO pilot plant in central Switzerland, which went 1994 into operation and is now still running. Geothermal road, bridge or outside surface heating is a feasible and approved possibility to increase traffic and public safety. Although the initial costs are high, such systems are not uneconomical. Social and macroeconomic benefits are given.},
