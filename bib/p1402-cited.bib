abstract = {This paper presents a summary of a laboratory and field research program designed to evaluate the application of remote sensing techniques to geothermal exploration and development. The primary objective was to establish the feasibility of performing initial reconnaissance of an unmapped area with airborne or spacecraft remote sensors. The field experiments were conducted against a series of known geothermal regions in California. These regions were chosen to represent a typical range of geologic and environmental settings. It was attempted to relate remotely sensed and in-situ geophysical measurements of representative geothermal regions through a diurnal and seasonal range of variation. Effects of varying flight altitude on thermal anomaly « signatures \aa are also presented. Multiband photography in the visible and near infra-red was used to delineate anomalous spectral reflectance associated with hydrothermal alteration zones, passive IR imagery and radiometry in the 8 to 14 $\mu$ band, as well as passive microwave radiometry at 16 and 19 GHz was used to detect combined temperature and emissivity anomalies. Preliminary laboratory studies of field samples served to define the sensor passbands to be employed and permit later interpretation of observed effects. Ground controls on the experiment included detailed thermometric, gravity, magnetic and subsurface heat flow mapping. The major results of this investigation may be summarized as the identification of temperature anomalies in not only the infrared; but also the microwave, Rayleigh-Jeans region of the spectrum. Subsidiary conclusions were the uniform presence of visible alteration haloes, soil moisture anomalies, and apparent structural control of the thermal zones. While these techniques were applied in the nature of a controlled experiment, the results are considered generally applicable to related problems of geologic reconnaissance.},

abstract = {Data from approximately 10,500 wells and more than 700 ground level data sets were used to develop a three-dimensional (3D) estimate of the subsurface temperature distribution in Germany. The temperature model was realized with universal kriging, and extends from ground level to 5000. m below sea level. Conventional two-dimensional (2D) mapping algorithms are often used to estimate subsurface temperature at certain depths. The major limitation of any 2D mapping is the possibility of inconsistencies between different depths due to the loss of information from shallower levels. A different approach is used in this paper. The application of 3D-kriging in the context of subsurface temperature estimation is described in detail and variation of data density and quality are also discussed. Kriging employs customized prediction parameters for an unbiased estimate of the subsurface temperature distribution. The kriging variance predicts the uncertainty of the temperature estimate and provides a local probability interval of the temperature estimate. The developed temperature model is part of the Geothermal Information System for Germany (GeotIS). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study examines two mapping method's sensitivity to the sampling density of the variable of interest, which is the thickness of a silty-clay–loam (TSCL) horizon. The two methods are simple linear regression (SLR) and universal kriging with external drift (UKEXD). As slope gradient ($\beta$) derived from a DEM, is available for the whole study area and linearly related to TSCL horizon, was used for TSCL prediction by SLR and by UKEXD. The accuracy performance of TSCL prediction using these methods was assessed by comparison with another group of 69 sample points (validation sample) where the TSCL is actually measured. In the validation procedure for the two methods, two indices were calculated from the validation sample (measured values) and predicted values. These two indices are the mean error (ME) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that UKEXD was more accurate than the SLR. The improvement of the accuracy of the prediction from SLR to UKEXD was about 38\%. To examine the effect of sampling density of TSCL (variable of interest) on the performance of both mapping methods, five subsets of 40, 50, 75, 100 and 125 observation sites of TSCL were randomly selected from the 150 sites of the prediction sample. For each subset, a prediction of TSCL was performed over the study area by: (i) SLR; (ii) UKEXD. The validation sample was used to compare the performance of the two methods according to the sample size of the variable of interest. The results show that whatever the sample size may be, UKEXD performs on average more accurate predictions than SLR. Moreover, the results indicate that UKEXD performed better when the sample size of the variable of interest increases. On the contrary, the performances with the linear regression remain stable whatever the sample size may be.},

The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from space. However, retrieving LST is still a challenging task since the LST retrieval problem is ill-posed. This paper reviews the current status of selected remote sensing algorithms for estimating LST from thermal infrared (TIR) data. A brief theoretical background of the subject is presented along with a survey of the algorithms employed for obtaining LST from space-based TIR measurements. The discussion focuses on TIR data acquired from polar-orbiting satellites because of their widespread use, global applicability and higher spatial resolution compared to geostationary satellites. The theoretical framework and methodologies used to derive the LST from the data are reviewed followed by the methodologies for validating satellite-derived LST. Directions for future research to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived LST are then suggested.},

Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of earth surface processes from local to global scales. The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from the space. Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) is the newest thermal infrared sensor for the Landsat project, providing two adjacent thermal bands, which has a great benefit for the LST inversion. In this paper, we compared three different approaches for LST inversion from TIRS, including the radiative transfer equation-based method, the split-window algorithm and the single channel method. Four selected energy balance monitoring sites from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) were used for validation, combining with the MODIS 8 day emissivity product. For the investigated sites and scenes, results show that the LST inverted from the radiative transfer equation-based method using band 10 has the highest accuracy with RMSE lower than 1 K, while the SW algorithm has moderate accuracy and the SC method has the lowest accuracy.},

abstract = {The Landsat program has been producing an archive of thermal imagery that spans the globe and covers 30 years of the thermal history of the planet at human scales 
(60–120 m). Most of that archive’s absolute radiometric calibration has been fixed through vicarious calibration techniques. These calibration ties to trusted values have often taken a year or more to gather sufficient data and, in some cases, it has been over a decade before calibration certainty has been established. With temperature being such a critical factor for all living systems and the ongoing concern over the impacts of climate change, NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are leading efforts to provide timely and accurate temperature data from the Landsat thermal data archive. This paper discusses two closely related advances that are critical steps toward providing timely and reliable temperature image maps from Landsat. The first advance involves the development and testing of an autonomous procedure for gathering and performing initial screening of large amounts of vicarious calibration data. The second advance discussed in this paper is the 
per-pixel atmospheric compensation of the data to permit calculation of the emitted surface radiance (using ancillary sources of emissivity data) and the corresponding land surface temperature (LST).},

abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is an important technique in the exploration of geothermal resources. In this study, a geothermal survey is conducted in Tengchong area of Yunnan province in China using TIR data from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor. Based on radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and emissivity calculation, a simple but efficient single channel algorithm with acceptable precision is applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) of study area. The LST anomalous areas with temperature about 4-10 K higher than background area are discovered. Four geothermal areas are identified with the discussion of geothermal mechanism and the further analysis of regional geologic structure. The research reveals that the distribution of geothermal areas is consistent with the fault development in study area. Magmatism contributes abundant thermal source to study area and the faults provide thermal channels for heat transfer from interior earth to land surface and facilitate the present of geothermal anomalies. Finally, we conclude that TIR remote sensing is a cost-effective technique to detect LST anomalies. Combining TIR remote sensing with geological analysis and the understanding of geothermal mechanism is an accurate and efficient approach to geothermal area detection. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The accurate imaging of geothermal systems from the ground surface down to great depths is an interdisciplinary problem common to geothermal resource exploration and development. Rocks can be characterized mainly in terms of their lithology, mineralogy, fracture distribution, permeability, thermal conductivity and porosity, and similarly the geothermal fluid (and its circulation) by its geochemistry, flow pattern, velocity, temperature and pressure. Some of these data are obtained by well logging and from laboratory tests conducted on drillhole cores. In general, the distribution of geothermal wells is not random, and well data are limited in terms of quantity and depth range. Accordingly, a sophisticated spatial modeling technique is indispensable in the three-dimensional imaging of geothermal systems. We describe a versatile 3-D modeling method that can be used to determine the temperature, flow velocity, and distribution of geological units within a geothermal field based on well log data. The model results for the Hohi geothermal area, Japan, provide plausible estimates of temperature, flow velocity, and geology to a depth of 3000 m. Superimposition of the three spatial models we obtained shows that, at Hohi, two geothermal reservoirs are localized near highly fractured fault zones that provide paths for the ascent of thermal fluids from depth. ?? 2007 CNR.},

abstract = {This paper is a comprehensive review of the potential for remote sensing in exploring for geothermal resources. Temperature gradients in the earth crust are typically 25–30°C per kilometer depth, however in active volcanic areas situated in subduction or rift zones gradients of up to 150°C per kilometer depth can be reached. In such volcanic areas, meteoric water in permeable and porous rocks is heated and hot water is trapped to form a geothermal reservoir. At the Earth's surface hot springs and fumaroles are evidence of hot geothermal water. In low enthalpy systems the heat can be used for heating/cooling and drying while in high enthalpy systems energy is generated using hot water or steam. In this paper we review the potential of remote sensing in the exploration for geothermal resources. We embark from the traditional suite of geophysical and geochemical prospecting techniques to arrive at parameters at the Earth surface that can be measured by earth observing satellites. Next, we summarize direct and indirect detection of geothermal potential using alteration mineralogy, temperature anomalies and heat fluxes, geobotanical anomalies and Earth surface deformation. A section of this paper is dedicated to published remote sensing studies illustrating the principles of mapping: surface deformation, gaseous emissions, mineral mapping, heat flux measurements, temperature mapping and geobotany. In a case study from the La Pacana caldera (Chili) geothermal field we illustrate the cross cutting relationships between various surface manifestations of geothermal reservoirs and how remotely sensed indicators can contribute to exploration. We conclude that although remote sensing of geothermal systems has not reached full maturity, there is great potential for integrating these surface measurements in a exploration framework. A number of recommendations for future research result from our analysis of geothermal systems and the present contributions of remote sensing to studying these systems. These are grouped along a number of question lines: ‘how reproducible are remote sensing products’, ‘can long term monitoring of geothermal systems be achieved’ and ‘do surface manifestations link to subsurface features’?},

abstract = {A surface energy balance was conducted to calculate the latent heat flux ($\lambda$E) using aerodynamic methods and the Penman–Monteith (PM) method. Computations were based on gridded weather and Landsat satellite reflected and thermal data. The surface energy balance facilitated a comparison of impacts of different parameterizations and assumptions, while calculating $\lambda$E over large areas through the use of remote sensing. The first part of the study compares the full aerodynamic method for estimating latent heat flux against the appropriately parameterized PM method with calculation of bulk surface resistance (rs). The second part of the study compares the appropriately parameterized PM method against the PM method, with various relaxations on parameters. This study emphasizes the use of separate aerodynamic equations (latent heat flux and sensible heat flux) against the combined Penman–Monteith equation to calculate $\lambda$E when surface temperature (Ts) is much warmer than air temperature (Ta), as will occur under water stressed conditions. The study was conducted in southern Idaho for a 1000-km2 area over a range of land use classes and for two Landsat satellite overpass dates. The results show discrepancies in latent heat flux ($\lambda$E) values when the PM method is used with simplifications and relaxations, compared to the appropriately parameterized PM method and full aerodynamic method. Errors were particularly significant in areas of sparse vegetation where differences between Ts and Ta were high. The maximum RMSD between the correct PM method and simplified PM methods was about 56 W/m2 in sparsely vegetated sagebrush desert where the same surface resistance was applied.},

New data have been taken from WGC2010 country update reports, private communications from IGA members and affiliated organizations. Other updates have been collected from websites of private and public organizations involved in geothermal development. Plants commissioned in 2010 (after WGC2010) have been included in the installed capacity, even though their produced energy has not been accounted for. An increase of about 2GW (herein we use MW and GW for the electrical capacity and MWth and GWth for thermal capacity) in the five year term 2005-2010 has been achieved (about 22\%), following the rough linear trend of approximately 400MW/year, with an evident increase of the average value of about 200MW/year in the 2000-2005 period (Bertani, 2005a,b, 2006, 2007). The most significant data to be highlighted from this paper are:???a total of 24 countries now generate electricity from geothermal resources;???the total installed capacity worldwide is 10,898MW, corresponding to about 67,246GWh of electricity (early 2010 data);???Germany, Papua - New Guinea, Australia, Turkey, Iceland, Portugal, New Zealand, Guatemala, Kenya, and Indonesia have increased the capacity of their power plant installations by more than 50\% with respect to the year 2005;???the top five countries for their electricity production are USA, Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico and Italy;???five countries realized an increase above 100MW with respect to 2005: USA, Indonesia, Iceland, New Zealand and Kenya.The prospective for growth during 2010-2015 are good, with a strong possibility of realizing a big increase in the installed capacity up to 19.

Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jim\'{e}nez-Mu\~{n}oz algorithm is used. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Air surface temperature (T air) is an important parameter for a wide range of applications such as vector-borne disease bionomics, hydrology and climate change studies. Air temperature data is usually obtained from measurements made in meteorological stations, providing only limited information about spatial patterns over wide areas. The use of remote sensing data can help overcome this problem, particularly in areas with low station density, having the potential to improve the estimation of T air at both regional and global scales. Some studies have tried to derive maximum (T max), minimum (T min) and average air temperature (T avg) using different methods, with variable estimation accuracy; errors generally fall in the 2-3??C range while the level of precision generally considered as accurate is 1-2??C. The main objective of this study was to accurately estimate T max, T min and T avg for a 10year period based on remote sensing-Land Surface Temperature (LST) data obtained from MODIS-and auxiliary data using a statistical approach. An optimization procedure with a mixed bootstrap and jackknife resampling was employed. The statistical models estimated Tavg with a MEF (Model Efficiency Index) of 0.941 and a RMSE of 1.33??C. Regarding T max and T min, the best MEF achieved was 0.919 and 0.871, respectively, with a 1.83 and 1.74??C RMSE. The developed datasets provided weekly 1km estimations and accurately described both the intra and inter annual temporal and spatial patterns of T air. Potential sources of uncertainty and error were also analyzed and identified. The most promising developments were proposed with the aim of developing accurate T air estimations at a larger scale in the future. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Wenchuan (汶川) earthquake triggered cascading disasters of landslides and debris flows that caused severe vegetation damage. Fracture zones can affect geodynamics and spatial pattern of vegetation damage. A segment tracing algorithm method was applied for identifying the regional fracture system through lineament extractions from a shaded digital elevation model with 25 m mesh for southern Wenchuan. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were used to analyze the spatiotemporal vegetation pattern. The relationship between vegetation type identified from satellite images and lineament density was used to characterize the distribution patterns of each vegetation type according to fracture zones. Broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, and farmland persist in areas with moderate lineament density. Deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forest persists in less fractured areas. Shrub and meadow seem to be relatively evenly distributed across all lineament densities. Meadow, farmland, and shrub persist in the fractured areas. Changes of spatial structure and correlation between vegetation patterns before and after the earthquake were examined using semivariogram analysis of normalized difference vegetation indices derived from Landsat enhanced thematic mapper images. The sill values of the semivariograms show that the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation covers increased after the earthquake. Moreover, the anisotropic behaviors of the semivariograms coincide with the vegetation changes due to the strikes of fracture zones.},

abstract = {Geothermal reservoirs are usually located at a depth range of 2 to 5 km, so to efficiently utilize such resources an advanced prospecting method is needed to detect these deep geologic structures. This study aimed to three-dimensionally characterize geothermal reservoirs by a combination of Magnetotelluric (MT) survey, inversion analysis of apparent resistivity, and interpolation of the resistivity data obtained. The western side of Mt. Aso crater, southwest Japan, was chosen as the case study area. Three hot springs exist there and a fault is assumed to go in the direction connecting them. A MT survey was carried out at 26 sites and the data processed by a remote reference method to reduce artificial noises. Based on skewness and Mohr circle analyses of the impedance tensor, the local geologic structure at each site could be approximated as horizontally layered and therefore, a one-dimensional inversion analysis was applied to the MT raw data. The resultant resistivity column data were then interpolated by the three-dimensional optimization principle method. The resistivity distributions obtained clarified continuous conductors with especially low resistivity (less than 10 $\Omega$·m) at the hot springs along the fault. Because the resistivity decreases largely with an abundance of clay minerals, the conductors could be considered to correspond with the cap rocks. Thus, two geothermal reservoirs, whose shapes were estimated to be pillar, were detected under the cap rocks in an elevation range of - 1000 to - 3000 m. By comparing the resistivity distributions with the temperature distributions based on fluid-flow calculations at a steady state using FEM, the validity of the location and dimension of the estimated reservoirs were confirmed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
